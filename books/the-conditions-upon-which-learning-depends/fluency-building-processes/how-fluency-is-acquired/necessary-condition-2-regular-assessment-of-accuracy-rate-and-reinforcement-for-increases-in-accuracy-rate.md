During fluency building, *two* dimensions of the learner's performance
need to be reinforced. The teaching procedure must be one which
continues to differentially reinforce *correct* responses because the
aim of fluency building is to build fast *and correct* responding but
reinforcement must also be provided for increases in *the rate* of
correct responding. In order to reinforce increases in fluency, those
increases must be made visible so that, when they occur, they can be
identified and reinforced.

This is most commonly achieved in one of two ways. The first is to
progressively reduce the time available for completing a standard task
(such as completing a certain number of lines of writing) (e.g., Ayllon,
Garber & Pisor, 1976; Hopkins, Schutte & Garton, 1971). The second is to
provide a timed exercise or self-test, to set, say, a 1-minute time
limit and to provide some kind of reinforcement for improvements in the
number of correct responses which can be performed per minute. Since the
increases in fluency which occur from one practice session to the next
may be quite small, the teacher must use a reasonably accurate and
sensitive measure of fluency.

Fluency can be measured by counting the number of correct responses
provided by the learner during a given period of time such as one minute
(e.g. Church, et al., 2005). Or it can be measured by the recording the
time which the learner takes to complete a procedure or task, or to
produce a specified number of correct responses (e.g. Young, West,
Howard & Whitney, 1986). Increases (from one test to the text) in the
number of correct responses which can be performed per unit of time
provide a measure of improvements in fluency.

In order to make improvements in fluency visible, fluency tests must
contain a reasonable number of items. To show a 3% improvement, the
fluency test must contain 33 items. To show a 2% improvement, the test
must contain 50 items, and to show a 1% improvement the test must
contain 100 items. Generally speaking, a fluency test of basic academic
skills should never consists of less than 33 items. This is because, the
rate of improvement which results *from daily testing alone* is an
increase of about 3% correct answers per minute per day.

Regardless of the procedure which is used to measure improvements in
fluency, it is essential that fluency be assessed regularly so that
improvements in accuracy rate are identified and reinforced when they
occur. If fluency building practice is occurring each day (as would
normally be the case), then the accuracy rate achieved by the learner
should be measured each day or at least every second day. This will not
involve extra teacher time since most measures of fluency can be applied
by the child herself (or by a peer if the children are working in
pairs).

The reinforcement for improvements in accuracy rate may take any of a
variety of forms: performance feedback (e.g., Rhymer, Ditmer, Skinner &
Jackson, 2000), praise (e.g., Kirby & Shields, 1972), contingent access
to preferred activities (e.g., Sandford, 1991; Hopkins, Schuttte &
Garton, 1971), notes to parents (e.g., Schloss, Sedlak, Elliot &
Smothers, 1982), and so on. One procedure which works well for most
students is for the student to keep a record of the results of daily
fluency tests on a personal graph. Being able to see improvements in
one\'s own fluency (and progress towards the fluency goal) functions as
a reinforcing consequence for a high proportion of students. If
self-recording does not provide sufficient motivation, the teacher may
make access to certain classroom privileges, games, or preferred
activities available to students contingent upon meeting successively
higher fluency targets.

During fluency building, it is no longer appropriate to provide feedback
following each individual response because this would interfere with the
learner's attempts to go faster. During fluency building, the assessment
of responses as correct and incorrect, and the correction of incorrect
responses, should occur at the end of blocks or sets of practice
responses (e.g., Miller, Hall & Heward, 1995).
