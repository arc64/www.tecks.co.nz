Fluency building activities may take a wide variety of forms: oral
quizzes, flash cards, 1-minute sprints on sheets of practice items
(e.g., Rhymer, Skinner, Hennington, D'Reaux & Sims, 1998), and games of
various kinds (e.g., Church, Nixon, Williams & Zintl, 2005). These
activities may or may not involve the teacher and may be conducted with
students individually, in pairs, in small groups, or in class size
groups (e.g., Pigott, Fantuzzo & Clement, 1986; Speltz, Shimamura &
McReynolds, 1982). Regardless of the fluency building activities which
are selected for use, those activities must be ones in which increases
in the rate of responding are, in fact, possible.

This means that fluency building activities must be activities in which
the rate of presentation is controlled by the learner. In order for the
learner to demonstrate that they can complete a task, or a set of test
items, more speedily than previously, progress through that task must be
under the control of the learner. Some kinds of practice activities do
not meet this requirement. A young child who has mastered letter names,
for example, may be able to name letters at a rate in excess of 80
letters per minute. If, during fluency building, letters are presented
to the child on cards at the rate of one every 3 seconds, the highest
level of fluency which the child can demonstrate is 20 letters per
minute (Church & Liberty, 1992). The problem described in the preceding
example can be avoided by using practice activities in which the learner
herself (or himself) controls the rate at which items are presented.
Sheets of questions meet this requirement.

Secondly, practice activities must contain a sufficient number of items.
During the initial learning of a new set of correct responses (such as
the names of the letters), it is more efficient for the learner to
practise these in relatively small groups of half a dozen items at a
time. During the fluency building phase of learning, however, we want
the student to become proficient at discriminating between all of the
items and in responding correctly to all of the items in the set. During
fluency building practice, therefore, it is appropriate that the student
practise with all of the items in the set (e.g. all 52 letters). When
proficient, however, most children can name letters at better than 80
letters per minute. It follows, therefore, that for a 1 minute sprint,
the practice sheet should contain at least 100 letters. Alternatively,
the child can practice with the 52 letters but the practice time can be
reduced to half a minute. Where the teaching aim is to teach mastery of
a new procedure, measuring the time which the student takes to complete
the procedure without assistance is the preferred way of measuring
improvements in fluency.
