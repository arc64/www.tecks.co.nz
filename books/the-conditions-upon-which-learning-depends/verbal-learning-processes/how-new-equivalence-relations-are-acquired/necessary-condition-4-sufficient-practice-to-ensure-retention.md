In order to learn a set of symbol--\>response equivalence relations the
learner must have multiple opportunities to practise responding to each
of the new symbols. Research suggests that, with this kind of learning
outcome, children can acquire the ability to respond correctly after
about three to six opportunities to practice each new response. McLay
(2004) found that 4-year old children could learn new object names after
an average of just three opportunities to name each object. McWilliams
(2006) found that the average 6- to 7-year old student could acquire new
spelling responses after an average of just five opportunities to spell
each unknown word.

Generally speaking, the equivalence relations taught in schools are ones
which we expect children to master. While the acquisition of new naming,
reading and spelling responses may occur after as few as three practice
responses, mastery of these responses requires fluency building practice
until each object, symbol or sound can be responded to correctly in less
than one second (Chiang & Schilling, 1983; Keel, Slaton & Blackhurst,
2001; Rinaldi, Sells & McLaughlin, 1997). This fluency building is
typically accomplished by providing daily 1-minute fluency building
sprints on the equivalence relations targeted for mastery (e.g., Chiang
& Schilling, 1983). Modern research into the building of fluency
(automaticity) tends to set a criterion of 60 to 70 correct responses
per minute because this is the fluency level which predicts long term
maintenance (retention) of new responses and skills. Keel et al. (2001)
report that 9- to 13-year old students who had been identified as
learning disabled required about 30 practice responses per word to
achieve a fluency criterion of 70 correct responses per minute on
reading a set of content-area vocabulary words.
