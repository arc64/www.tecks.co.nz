# Necessary condition 1.Â Prompting of the correct responses

The child who is asked to name the letter w, or to read the word worst,
or to name the element referred to by the symbol Fe for the very first
time will not be able to respond correctly because they will not know
what the correct response is supposed to be. This observation reminds us
that, if the stimulus is new, then initial attempts to respond will need
to be prompted in some way.

-   New reading responses may be prompted by the context in which the
    word appears or by telling the learner what the word is (Espin &
    Deno, 1989; Keel & Gast, 1992). As the learner becomes more
    competent, new reading responses may be self-prompted by the learner
    "sounding out the word" (provided that the necessary
    grapheme-\>phoneme equivalence relations have been acquired).
-   The correct answer to a new maths fact may be prompted by telling
    the student the answer or by teaching the student a rule whereby
    they can work out the answer for themselves (e.g. by counting up for
    single digit addition).
-   The correct spelling of a new word may be prompted by allowing the
    student, initially, to copy the correct spelling of the word (e.g.
    Telecsan, Slaton & Stevens, 1999) or by providing a phonetic
    pronunciation of the word (provided that the necessary phoneme--\>
    grapheme equivalence relations have been acquired).
-   Sometimes the correct response can be prompted by providing a table
    of equivalence relations for the learner to refer to (e.g. a matrix
    of products for single digit multiplication facts, or a list which
    shows the chemical symbols which are used to represent each of the
    elements).

Once the learner begins to respond correctly to a particular stimulus,
prompting of the response to that stimulus should cease so that the
practice of independent responding can begin (Espin & Deno, 1989;
Hendrickson, Roberts & Shores, 1978; Johnson, Schuster & Bell, 1996;
Keel & Gast, 1992).
