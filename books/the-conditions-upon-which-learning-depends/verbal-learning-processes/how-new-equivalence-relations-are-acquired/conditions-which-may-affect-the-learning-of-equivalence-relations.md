The careful sequencing and systematic practice of new equivalence
relations can result in rapid mastery of new naming, reading and
spelling responses. Research has also identified a number of additional
conditions which, although not essential for learning, may function to
accelerate the rate at which new equivalence relations will be learned
and remembered.

**1. The size of the practice set used during initial teaching**

Research to date suggests that during the initial acquisition phase, new
equivalence relations should be taught and practised in relatively small
sets. The research suggests that, with younger learners, new responses
should be introduced in sets of half a dozen or less. Silbert, Carnine
and Stein (1981, p. 230) argue that basic maths facts should be
introduced in sets of three or four facts. With older learners the set
size can probably be increased to 8 to 10 new items at a time. The main
requirement to be met seems to be that practice sets should contain a
number of items which exceeds the short term memory capacity of the
learner so that the learner cannot simply respond to each item from
short term memory (Bryant, Drabin & Gettinger, 1981; Johnson, Gersten &
Carnine, 1987).

**2. The interspersal ratio of new to previously acquired responses**

A number of researchers have studied the effects of creating practice
sets which include both known (old) and unknown (new) stimulus items.
The technical name for this procedure is *interspersal training*
(because new and old items are interspersed within the practice set).
The most commonly used interspersal practice procedure is reading
practice using controlled vocabulary stories where at least 85 per cent
of the words in the story are words which the leaner has already learned
to read. Interspersal training almost always results in more rapid
acquisition of new correct responses than is the case when the learner
practises with sets which consist entirely of new items (Koegel &
Koegel, 1986; Neef, Iwata & Page, 1977, 1980).

Why is this? Some writers argue that the faster learning which occurs
during interspersal training is due to the fact that the learner makes
fewer errors (because many of the items are already known). With fewer
errors, the learner also receives more reinforcement for being correct.
However, it might also be because the interspersal training provides
more effective and error-free discrimination training. It will be
recalled that, in learning to respond correctly to new stimuli, the
learner must not only learn which response to give to the new stimulus
but must also to discriminate between the new stimulus and all other
stimuli in the set. By including previously mastered items in the
current practice set, it is possible for the teacher to include
(previously mastered) stimulus items which are similar in appearance to
the new items. Practice sets which include old as well as new items
provide the learner with both kinds of practice (practice in
discriminating the new stimulus from other stimuli as well as practice
in responding correctly).

**3. The extent to which easily confused items are placed in different
teaching sets**

A number of writers (e.g. Engelmann & Carnine, 1991; Kameenui & Simmons,
1990) have argued that closely similar stimulus items should not be
taught together but should be introduced several days apart. "As a
general rule, the more similar the stimuli are, the more difficult the
discrimination will be for the learner. For example, in teaching
decoding skills, the letter-\>sound associations of b and d are well
known for the confusion they cause learners because of their similarity
both visually and auditorily. We recommend separating the introduction
of stimuli that are visually . . . similar" (Kameenui & Simmons, 1990,
p. 136).

Although this advice runs contrary to common practice, the research
suggests that it does result in faster learning. In a series of
experiments, Carnine (1976, 1980, 1981) found that letter--\>sound
equivalence relations were always acquired more quickly when closely
similar letters were spaced far apart in the teaching sequence than when
they were introduced one after the other in the teaching sequence. This
procedure results in fewer errors during the learning of each of the
(easily confused) letter--\>sound relations and, hence, faster learning.
If the two easily confused letter--\>sound equivalences are introduced
together, the learner tends to make many more errors (because of the
similarity of the stimulus items) and, as a result, it takes the learner
much longer to learn to respond correctly to each.

**4. The degree of fluency achieved prior to introducing the next set of
new responses**

One of the major difficulties in teaching new equivalence relations is
that the retention of previously learned responses tends to be disrupted
by practice on later sets of equivalence relations. This phenomenon has
been well documented (Postman & Underwood, 1973). The interference
effect which occurs during this type of learning is referred to by
different writers as *interference,* as *retroactive inhibition,* as
*retroactive interference,* and as *competition* (Howe, 2002). The
simplest way of reducing competition (and the errors which result from
competition) is to ensure that each new item (or small set of new items)
is well learned before the next new item (or set of new items) is
introduced. By well learned is meant that the child can respond
correctly in less than 1 second. This is especially important in the
case of stimulus items which are confused by large numbers of students.

**5. The use of devices which make sets of equivalence relations more
memorable**

The mastery of new equivalence relations is a difficult task at all age
levels. So any teaching procedure or study procedure which makes the
correct responses easier to remember is likely to increase the rate at
which these are acquired. Both research and practical experience suggest
that there are a number of devices which function to make new items more
memorable. These include rhymes, songs, mnemonics, imagery and rules.

*Rhymes*. One way of making new items more memorable is to cast them
into the form of a rhyme. For some reason rhymes are easier to remember
than lists which do not rhyme. For example, most people use a rhyme to
remember the days of the month: *Thirty days hath September, April, June
and November. All the rest have thirty-one except for February alone
which has twenty eight or twenty nine.* Some teachers use the following
rhyme to help children remember 7x7=49: *Seven sevens are forty-nine*

*Forty-nine is nearly fifty*

*Seven sevens are forty-nine*

*Forty-nine is really nifty*

*Songs*. Like rhymes, songs are also more memorable than prose lists.
Many young children learn to recite the alphabet using the alphabet song
"*A, B, C, D, E, F, G. H, I, J, K, L-M-N-O-P."* And there are many
children who learned to count backwards by singing

*Ten little, nine little, eight little Indians*

*Seven little, six little, five little Indians*

*Four little, three little, two little Indians*

*One little Indian boy.*

*Mnemonics*. A mnemonic is a word, acronym, or sentence which is easy to
remember and in which each of the letters or initial letters functions
as a prompt for the responses which the learner wants to remember.
Goetz, Alexander & Ash (1992, p. 443) give the following example of a
mnemonic which can be used to prompt recall of the names of the planets:
*My very elegant mother just sat upon nine porcupines.* The first letter
of each word in the sentence is also the initial letter in a planet
name. In order, the planets are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. Of course, a new mnemonic will be
required now that Pluto no longer has the status of a planet. Mnemonics
have been found to function as an effective memory aid in a variety of
different kinds of equivalence relations tasks (e.g., Agramonte &
Belfiore, 2002; Greene, 1999; Mastropieri, Scruggs & Whedon 1997; Wood,
Frank & Wacker, 1998). For a review of the research into the
effectiveness of mnemonics see Scruggs and Mastropieri (1990).

*Imagery.* Sometimes a new discrimination can be made more memorable by
associating it with an image (e.g., Caban, Hambleton, Coffing, Conway &
Swaminathan, 1978). For example some children learn to discriminate
between b and d by associating these stimuli with the image of a bed.

*Patterns*. Some equivalence relations come in sets where the existence
of a pattern makes then more memorable. For example, there is a pattern
to number fact series such as *1+1=2, 2+1=3, 3+1=4, 4+1=5* which makes
them easy to remember. Number facts can also be grouped into "families
of facts" e.g. *3+6=9, 6+3=9, 9-6=3, 9-3=6* and, when they are grouped
in this way, the memory load for the learner is much reduced. Some
children learn the nine times table by remembering the pattern *9, 18,
27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90* (e.g., Wood, Frank & Wacker, 1998).

**6. The extent to which the learner is able to apply self-rehearsal
strategies**

There are things which the learner can do to speed up the acquisition of
new symbol-\> response relationships. One of these is to actively
self-rehearse each new relationship. For example, the teacher can teach
the learner how to self-rehearse responding correctly to new stimulus
items. The simplest self-rehearsal procedure is *cover, copy, compare*.
The learner examines the stimulus item (such as a new spelling word),
covers the word, writes the spelling word, and then checks his or her
own response against the printed stimulus. Teaching children to use the
cover-copy-compare self-rehearsal procedure has been shown to accelerate
acquisition on a variety of equivalence relation learning tasks (e.g.
Conley, Derby, Roberts-Gwinn, Weber & McLaughlin, 2004; McGuffin, Martz
& Heron, 1997; Okyere, Heron & Goddard, 1997; Skinner, Beatty, Turco &
Rasavage, 1989; Stading, Williams & McLaughlin, 1996).

In New Zealand, many children learn the Spell-Write self-rehearsal
procedure for learning new spelling words. The effects on rate of
acquisition of teaching students to use the Spell-Write procedure have
been examined in a number of experiments. In almost every experiment,
teaching the learner to use the Spell-Write self-rehearsal procedure
resulted in a doubling of the number of spelling words mastered by the
learner during 10-15 minute practice sessions. This doubled learning
rate occurred with children spanning the age range from 5 to 13 years
and occurred with learning disabled children as well as normally
developing children (Church, 1992).

**7. The extent to which rules can be, and are taught**

A number of sets of symbol--\>response correspondences follow specific
rules. This is most obvious in mathematics. For example, the commutative
rule states that *3+8=8+3* and that *2x4=4x2*, for example. Teaching
this rule greatly reduces the number of maths "facts" which have to be
learned. Pupils can also be taught how to work out the answers to
addition facts by counting up (*4+2; count up two; 5, 6; 4+2=6),* how to
work out the answers to subtraction facts by counting on (*6-4; four
count 5, 6; this is counting on two, 6-4=2),* and how to work out the
answers to multiplication facts by counting by (*2x4 count by two four
times; 2, 4, 6, 8; 2x4=8)*. Once these rules have been learned, all of
the "basic maths facts" can be derived by the learner. This means that,
if a particular answer cannot be remembered during practice, it can be
derived by the learner (Lloyd, Saltzman & Kauffman, 1981; Van Houten,
1993). In the Van Houten experiment, 6- to 11-year old students who were
taught a rule for finding the answer to single digit subtraction facts
learned seven subtraction facts in half the time required without the
rule.

There are also a number of rules which can be taught to facilitate the
development of reading skills. In reading, certain letter-\>sound
correspondences recur consistently, that is, in a high proportion of
words. Kameenui and Simmons (1990, p. 213) make the point that the
following 14 vowel-vowel and vowel-consonant combinations are pronounced
in the same way more than 70% of the time:

*ai* as in bait*ou* as in ounce*oi* as in coin*ow* own/cow*ur* as in
burn

*ea* as in each*oo* as in boot*oa* as in coat*ir* as in bird*ar* as in
barn

*ee* as in bleed*au* as in cause*ay* as in day*er* as in term

Where rules exist, these rules should be taught. In reading, this means
that common grapheme--\>phoneme relationships (letter--\>sound
relationships) should be taught as rules. Practice in applying
grapheme--\>phoneme relationship rules is necessary because, once these
rules have been learned, the child will be able to decode new words
without assistance and the rate of acquisition of new reading skills
will be very greatly increased (e.g. Foorman, Francis, Novy & Liberman,
1991; Vandervelden & Siegel, 1997). For a review of the research into
teaching grapheme--\>phoneme relationships (phonics) and its effects on
learning to read, see National Reading Panel (2001).

**8. The extent to which exceptions are taught**

The thing to remember about the teaching of rules is that younger
children tend to assume that a rule applies in all cases. The technical
name for this phenomenon is *overgeneralisation*. Where the rule which
is being taught is a rule which has exceptions, it is important that at
least some of the exceptions to the rule are taught at the same time
that the rule is being taught. Otherwise, there is a high likelihood
that the learner will overgeneralise the rule. Let us say, for example,
that the teacher is teaching the rule that *"ai makes the ai sound as in
rain and bait"*. If this rule was being taught, the teacher should also
teach that there are exceptions such as *villain* and *captain* so the
child does not overgeneralise the rule.

Spelling rules are "rules" which almost always have exceptions. It
follows that any instruction in spelling rules should always include
instruction in the exceptions. The following examples (of spelling
rules) illustrate.

1.We double *l*, *f*, *s*, after a single vowel at the end of a short
word, e.g. call, tell, toss, moss, stiff, stuff. Exceptions: us, bus,
gas, if, of, this, yes, plus, nil, pal.

2.The *i* sound and the *ee* sound at the end of a word is nearly always
spelled *y*. No English words end in *i*. Exceptions: macaroni,
spaghetti, vermicelli (Italian), taxi (short for taxicab), coffee,
committee.

3.Nouns ending in a single *f* change the *f* to *v* before adding *es*
to form the plural, e.g. leaves, wolves. Exceptions: dwarfs, roofs,
chiefs.

4.The consonant *l* is always doubled before a suffix which begins with
a vowel, e.g. compelled, labelled, modelled. Exceptions: unparalleled,
naturalist, devilish, liberalism.

5.Words which end with *consonant-o*, usually add *es* to form the
plural. e.g. potatoes, tomatoes, volcanoes, torpedoes. Exceptions:
pianos, solos, Eskimos, zeros.
