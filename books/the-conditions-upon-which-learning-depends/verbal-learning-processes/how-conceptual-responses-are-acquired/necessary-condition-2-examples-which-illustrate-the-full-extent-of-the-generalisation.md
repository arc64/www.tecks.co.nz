If the learner is to acquire a new generalisation, practice
opportunities must include a number of examples from the stimulus set
(Haring, 1985; Tateyama-Snieziek, 1989).

In order to avoid the development of misconceptions these examples must
illustrate the full range of the generalisation which is to be acquired
(Becker & Carnine, 1980; Engelmann & Carnine, 1991). Carnine (1990) **
illustrates the importance of this condition using the following
example. Young children are often taught the concept of *a fraction*
using examples which show a pie cut into fractions. This leads to the
undergeneralisation that a fraction is always smaller than 1 and leads
to errors when the teacher introduces fractions (such as two-and-a
quarter) which are greater than one. This difficulty can be avoided by
introducing examples of fractions which are both less than 1 and greater
than 1 from the outset. If this is done, the generalisation will be
acquired more rapidly because the errors which result from initially
teaching an undergeneralisation are avoided.

Although research into concept learning under classroom conditions is
relatively sparse, such research as has been undertaken supports the
conclusion that a range of positive examples, rather than just typical
examples, result in better performance on generalisation tests (Becker &
Carnine, 1980; Carnine, 1980). In one experiment, students who were
presented with a full range of positive examples of how to convert
fractions into decimals obtained higher scores on a generalisation test
(82% correct) than students who were presented with only a restricted
range of examples (40% correct) (Becker & Carnine, 1980).
