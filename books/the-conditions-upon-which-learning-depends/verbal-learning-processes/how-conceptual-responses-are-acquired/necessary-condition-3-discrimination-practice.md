# Necessary condition 3.Â Discrimination practice

In order to acquire a new generalisation, the learner must learn to
distinguish between (and to respond differently to) instances which are,
and which are not, members of the stimulus class. There are few concepts
which can be taught using positive examples alone. The great majority of
concepts can only be mastered if the learner experiences both examples
and non-examples. Non-examples are necessary to teach what the concept
is *not*.

To learn the discrimination between nouns and other parts of speech, for
example, the learner must have practice in identifying (and naming)
nouns in exercises which include examples of both nouns and other parts
of speech. In order to learn the discrimination between multiplication
word problems and other kinds of problems, the learner must be provided
with practice exercises which include both multiplication problems and
other types of word problems.

The non-examples which are most informative, and which result in the
most rapid concept formation are the close-in non-examples, that is,
non-examples which are closely similar to the positive examples selected
for instruction (Becker & Carnine, 1980; Carnine, 1980a, 1980b; Williams
& Carnine, 1981).
