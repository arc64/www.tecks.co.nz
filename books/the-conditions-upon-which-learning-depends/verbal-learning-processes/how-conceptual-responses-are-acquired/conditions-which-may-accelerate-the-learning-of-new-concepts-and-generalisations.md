The research into the learning of new generalisations also identifies a
number of additional teaching variables which may be managed to
accelerate the acquisition of generalised correct responding.

**1. The opportunity to experience concrete examples and non-examples**

One way of accelerating the development of generalised correct
responding is to use concrete examples and non-examples to teach the
discrimination between different stimulus classes. Teachers have long
believed that the use of concrete examples results in better
"understanding" and research to date is consistent with this belief
(e.g., Gersten, White, Falco & Carnine, 1982).

With younger learners and some concepts, the use of concrete examples is
almost an essential condition. "For example, teaching the
discriminations *longer, not longer*, or *blue, not blue,* with rules or
verbal explanations, is impractical. Students who do not respond
correctly to \'Is the pencil longer than the pen?\' are unlikely to
benefit from this explanation: \'Longer means greater extension in the
horizontal dimension\'" (Becker & Carnine, 1980, p. 453).

With other concepts, the use of concrete examples is not an essential
condition but it does help the learner to acquire the generalisation
more quickly. "Concrete examples are used to allow the learner to
observe (e.g. by seeing, feeling, touching, holding, pushing) what
can\'t be cognitively digested and processed by the use of abstract
words" (Kameenui & Simmons, 1990, p. 150).

**2. The opportunity to learn a definition of the stimulus class**

The process of teaching the learner to attend to and to respond to the
critical samenesses which define membership in a stimulus class can
often be accelerated by prompting attention to the critical features.
This can be accomplished in a variety of ways:

-   By teaching the definition of the stimulus class in the case of
    concepts, for example: "An acute angle is an angle of less than 45
    degrees."
-   By pointing to one of the characteristics which are common to
    members of the stimulus class, for example: "Insects have six legs."
-   By teaching a rule which can be used to identify members of the
    stimulus class, for example, "If the problem asks 'How many
    altogether?' you have to add."
-   By teaching the student to use a previously mastered concept to
    identify examples of a new concept. For example the student who
    could identify metals but who could not identify electrical
    conductors might be told: "All metals are conductors."
-   By teaching a test which can be used to identify examples: "Does it
    feel sandy? If it feels sandy, then it is a sedimentary rock."

In all of these examples, the teacher is using a stimulus prompting
procedure to draw the learner's attention to the sameness which must be
attended to if the student is to respond correctly to all members of the
stimulus class. The provision of a definition at the beginning of a
concept teaching lesson greatly accelerates the acquisition of
generalised correct responding. When Ross and Carnine (1982) compared
the effects of teaching an artificial mathematics concept to 10 year old
students, 15/15 of the students who started with a definition acquired
the concept whereas only 4/15 students who received only examples and
non-examples acquired the concept.

As students become older and more knowledgeable, increasing numbers of
new generalisations can be taught in part by teaching the rule which
defines membership in the stimulus set. This is because, as the child\'s
vocabulary expands, the defining qualities of increasing numbers of
concepts can be described in words which are meaningful for the student.

Even where definitions are being taught, however, some practice with
actual examples and non-examples will almost always be necessary. There
are few students who would be able to distinguish between *similes* and
*metaphors* with a high level of accuracy after having been taught only
the definition of these two figures of speech, for example.

Note that if definitions or rules are being taught, and the rules have
exceptions, then these exceptions must also be taught. Otherwise the
student will learn an overgeneralisation. We cannot teach the concept of
fish to younger learners by defining fish as animals which live in water
without also teaching the child that whales and dolphins are not fish,
for example.

**3. Whether or not general case teaching sequences are used**

After reviewing the scientific research into the conditions which are
most effective in producing generalised correct responding, White et al.
(1988, p. 39) reached the following conclusion: "It would appear, on the
basis of admittedly limited evidence, that general case programming is
the strategy of choice for facilitating generalisation from
instructional to applied situations".

What is general case programming? *General case programming involves the
selection and sequencing of teaching examples in such a way as to teach
the desired generalisation.* "A general case has been taught when, after
instruction on some tasks in a particular class, any task in that class
can be performed correctly. When a general case has been taught with
respect to a class of stimuli, we say a concept has been taught" (Becker
& Engelmann, 1978, p. 325). A detailed account of general case
programming will be found in Engelmann and Carnine (1991).

With general case programming, a sufficient number and range of positive
examples is selected to ensure that the learner acquires the ability to
recognise the outer boundaries of the stimulus class.

With general case programming, sufficient negative examples are selected
to teach the discrimination between members and non-members of the
stimulus class.

With general case programming, examples are sequenced so that adjacent
positive examples are maximally different*.* This is the most efficient
procedure for teaching the student the outer boundaries of the stimulus
class. Faced with the fact that a yellowy-orange colour and a
reddish-orange colour are both labelled "orange", the learner will
quickly infer that all intermediate shades of orange must also be
labelled "orange" and acquisition of this colour concept will be greatly
accelerated.

With general case programming, example/non-example pairs are sequenced
so that minimally different example/non-example pairs occur together. In
teaching the concept of *vertical*, the most informative negative
example is the line which deviates only slightly from the vertical. In
teaching the concept of orange, the most informative negative example is
the one which is only slightly too yellow to be labelled "orange". Faced
with this example, the learner will quickly infer that all examples
which are even more yellow than this example must also be "not orange".
Minimally different example/non-example pairs result in faster learning
of the discrimination between examples and non-examples than
example/non-example pairs which are more obviously different (Becker &
Carnine, 1980; Carnine, 1980a, 1980b; Williams & Carnine, 1981).

With general case programming, examples and non-examples are sequenced
in such a way that only one feature changes from one example (or
non-example) to the next. To teach the difference between examples and
non-examples, the teacher presents example/non-example pairs in which
the irrelevant features are held constant and the only change from one
instance to the next is the presence or absence of the defining
characteristic. In order to respond correctly, the learner must attend
to the feature which is changing, that is, the feature which defines
membership in the stimulus class. This results in more rapid acquisition
of the two discriminations which must be acquired during the initial
learning of a new concept or generalisation (Carnine, 1980b; Schumaker,
1974; Gersten, White, Falco & Carnine, 1982; Granzin & Carnine, 1977).

A number of separate experiments have demonstrated that both normal and
learning disabled students acquire new concepts more rapidly from
teaching sequences based on the five rules of general case teaching
(e.g., Becker & Carnine, 1980; Carnine, 1980a; 1980b; Granzin & Carnine,
1977; Kelly, Gersten & Carnine, 1990; Sprague and Horner, 1984; Williams
& Carnine, 1981).

**4. The extent to which the teacher is able to keep the working memory
load low for the learner during initial teaching of the generalisation**

Children can hold in mind only a very limited number of items of
information at any one time. This must be taken into account during the
teaching of new generalisations. This is because the acquisition of a
generalised correct response typically involves practice with many more
than just three or four examples. Teachers employ a number of procedures
in their attempts to reduce working memory demands during practice with
positive and negative examples of a stimulus class.

-   The definition of the stimulus class can be presented at the
    beginning and kept in view during practice. In teaching correct use
    of the terms *integer* and *real number*, for example, the teacher
    can put the two definitions on the board and students can use these
    to prompt responding to new examples and non-examples from each
    stimulus class.
-   An example or examples from the stimulus class can be presented at
    the beginning and kept in view during practice. For example, the
    teacher could put an example of a *real number* and an example of an
    *integer* on the board and pupils could use these to prompt
    responding to new examples and non-examples from each stimulus
    class.
-   The instances can be kept in view. For example, each example could
    be written on the board under the headings *real number, integer,*
    and *neither*. If practice examples are kept in view, the samenesses
    which are common to the positive examples also remain in view
    (rather than being forgotten as new instances are presented).
-   Examples and non-examples can be sequenced so that only one feature
    changes as the learner moves from one example to the next. In this
    way the student has only to remember the single feature which has
    changed in order to continue responding correctly.

**5. The extent to which undergeneralisations and overgeneralisations
are identified and corrected**

Few generalisations are completely new to the learner. Most learners
arrive at their first geometry lesson already able to identify circles,
squares, and triangles, for example. However, these early understandings
will sometimes consist of undergeneralisations (as in the case of
students who believe that a fraction is something less than one whole)
and will sometimes consist of overgeneralisations (as in the case of
students who believe that all four sided figures are "squares"). (These
undergeneralisations and overgeneralisations are often referred to as
"misconceptions". We have avoided using the term "misconception" in this
account because, if a child has a misconception, we need to know what
kind of misconception it is in order to select the appropriate
corrective teaching strategy.)

The research on concept teaching shows that the teaching which is needed
to correct an undergeneralisation is different from the teaching which
is needed to correct an overgeneralisation (Engelmann & Carnine, 1991).

-   Undergeneralisations are corrected by provided additional practice
    with a wider range of positive examples.
-   Overgeneralisations are corrected by providing additional practice
    with negative examples - especially those which are being confused
    with positive examples.

These different kinds of teaching can only be provided if the teacher
has identified the type of error which the student is making (an
undergeneralisation error or an overgeneralisation error). It seems
reasonable to assume that teaching procedures which identify the
undergeneralisations and overgeneralisations held by individual
learners, and which attempt to correct these, will result in more rapid
acquisition of an accurate generalisation than will be the case with
teaching procedures which fail to identify the causes of student errors.
As far as we can determine, this assumption has yet to be tested
experimentally.
