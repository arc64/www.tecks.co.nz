# Necessary condition 1.Â Prompting of correct responses

When the child is first asked to distinguish between (and to name)
examples of real numbers and examples of integers, or examples of verbs
and examples of adverbs, or examples of mass and examples of weight,
they will not be able to respond correctly because they will not "know"
what the correct response is supposed to be. In other words, the
*response* which is appropriate to examples from an unknown stimulus
class must initially be prompted in some way. Where the response is a
concept name (which it will be in many cases), this response can be
prompted simply by telling the learner the correct name.

Although not essential, it is customary to pair the *name* of the
concept or stimulus class with a definition of the concept, that is with
a reference to the critical *sameness* which defines membership in the
stimulus class, for example "These words are the names of things. They
are called nouns", or "In these problems there are a number of equal
sized sets. These problems are multiplication problems". While the
research into concept formation is extensive (Bourne, 1966) most of this
research has involved withholding the definitions of the experimental
concepts in order to study the effects of variations in the examples and
non-examples provided. During concept teaching, in contrast, it is
customary to present the definition of a new concept from the outset and
this is clearly an appropriate practice (Ross & Carnine, 1982).

Of course, any prompts which are required during the initial stages of
instruction must be withdrawn as soon as the student can respond without
them otherwise the development of independent performance will be
postponed.
