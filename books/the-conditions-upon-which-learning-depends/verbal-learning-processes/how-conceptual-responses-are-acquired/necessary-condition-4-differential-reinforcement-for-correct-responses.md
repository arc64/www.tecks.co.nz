If the child is to learn to respond differently to examples and to
non-examples of a stimulus class, then correct responding must be
differentially reinforced. Note that when the learner is practising
generalised correct responding, they may respond correctly or
incorrectly to examples and correctly or incorrectly to non-examples.
This means that there are two types of correct responses (correct
responses to examples and correct responses to non-examples). *Both
types of correct responses* must be differentially reinforced. It is as
important to reinforce correct identification of a non-example as it is
to reinforce correct identification of an example. This is the kind of
feedback which has been used in all of the experimental analyses of
concept learning cited in this section.

Although the assumption has never been studied experimentally, it seems
safe to assume that for many younger learners and for most older
learners, feedback which identifies correct responses as correct will
provide sufficient reinforcement for generalised correct responding to
develop. If learning is slow, or motivation flags, before the
generalisation has been acquired then the teacher may need to introduce
consequences for correct responding which are, in fact, reinforcing for
the individual learner.
