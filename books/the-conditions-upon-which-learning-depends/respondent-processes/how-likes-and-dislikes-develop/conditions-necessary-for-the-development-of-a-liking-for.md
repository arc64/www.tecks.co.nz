What must the teacher do to ensure that the learner develops a liking
for a particular class of learning activities such as reading? In spite
of its importance, the question has prompted almost no controlled
experimental research.

However the answer to the question may be inferred from our
understanding of how likes and dislikes develop. It seems likely that,
*in order to develop a liking* *for a particular class of learning
activities, the learner's experiences with that activity must be ones in
which reinforcing outcomes are much more frequent than punishing
outcomes*.

Unfortunately, because the research has yet to be undertaken, we do not
yet know the ratio of reinforcing to punishing outcomes which are
necessary for (a) the development of a liking for and (b) the
development of a dislike. Various authorities have estimated that, in
order to develop a liking for a particular type of activity (such as
reading) the learner must experience (during study and practice)
somewhere between three times as many to five times as many reinforcing
outcomes as aversive outcomes.

Assuming this to be the case, the implications for parents and teachers
are profound because they will apply to every single facet of the
learner's interactions with his or her environment.

1.If a teacher wants to ensure that her students like her, she must
ensure that her interactions with students are predominantly positive
interactions and she must apply this rule equally to all students
including those whom she finds least engaging and least attractive.

2.If a teacher wants his students to develop a liking for a particular
subject, the teacher must ensure that student experiences while working
on that subject are predominantly reinforcing (successful) and he must
apply this rule equally to all students including those who are making
the least progress in that subject.

3.If teachers want their students to develop a liking for school in
general, they must ensure that their management procedures and their
disciplinary procedures involve, predominantly, reinforcement for
appropriate behaviour (rather than punishment for misbehaviour) and they
must apply this rule equally to all students including the most poorly
behaved.

4.If a teacher wants her students to develop a love of learning, she
must ensure that students experience predominantly reinforcing outcomes
(success) in all subjects including those which students generally
experience as tedious and difficult.
