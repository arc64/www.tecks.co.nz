The only condition which has been demonstrated to be necessary for the
acquisition of a conditioned anxiety or fear response (both realistic
and unrealistic) is the repeated contiguous occurrence of the
conditioned eliciting stimulus (which already elicits the anxiety or
fear response) and the unconditioned eliciting stimulus, that is, the
stimulus or event which initially has no anxiety eliciting properties
but which subsequently acquires such properties (Davey, 1997; Vasey &
Dadds, 2001; Watson & Rayner, 1920). There may well be other necessary
conditions, such as the form or intensity of the anxiety elicited during
the experience in which the conditioning occurred, but the effects of
variables such as these have yet to be measured.
