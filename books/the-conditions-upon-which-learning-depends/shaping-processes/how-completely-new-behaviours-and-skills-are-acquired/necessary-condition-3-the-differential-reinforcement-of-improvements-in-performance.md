The third essential condition which must be met in order for new
behaviours to be acquired is the differential reinforcement of
improvements in performances during practice. Unless improvements
generate more reinforcement than non-improvements, improvement does not
occur. There has been fairly extensive research into what happens to
skill development when the learner is required to practise without any
feedback regarding the accuracy of their practice responses. Without
this feedback, no improvement in accuracy occurs (Allison & Ayllon,
1980; Buzas & Ayllon 1981; Fitterling & Ayllon, 1983; Koop & Martin,
1983; Lahey, Busemeyer, O\'Hara & Beggs, 1977; Shapiro & Shapiro, 1985;
Sweeney, Salva, Cooper & Talbert-Johnson, 1993; Trap, Milner-Davis,
Joseph & Cooper, 1978; Ward, Crouch & Patrick, 1998).

*Differential reinforcement provided by the natural environment.* Often
the differential reinforcement of improvements in performance is
provided by the natural environment and occurs automatically and without
any intervention on the part of a human teacher or coach.

-   When the child is learning to walk, to run, to ride a bicycle, to
    skate, or to ski, improvements in skill are reinforced by the
    increased mobility which the child achieves. Incompetent
    performances, on the other hand, result in falls which, if not
    painful, are certainly embarrassing. In other words, competent
    performances are automatically reinforced and incompetent
    performances are automatically punished.
-   The same is true of many sports skills. As competence increases, the
    child\'s ability to win points, runs, goals, baskets, and so on,
    increases. Increasingly skilled performance in the game or sport
    produces increasingly higher scores and increasing amounts of
    reinforcement.
-   Musical performance skills are also differentially reinforced by the
    product of the behaviour. The initial, unskilled and hesitant
    attempts to play a new tune generate little reinforcement. But each
    improvement in performance is reinforced by an increasingly melodic
    and better sounding result.

*Differential reinforcement provided by the social environment.* Where
increases in competence are not automatically reinforced by the results
of the performance, this differential reinforcement must be provided by
another person. This is the case with all social skills such as learning
to talk, learning what to say in different situations and how to say it,
and learning the eye contact, demeanour and body language responses
which are appropriate to different situations. Where the physical
environment fails to provide differential reinforcement, this
reinforcement may be provided by a teacher (e.g. Trap et al., 1978), a
coach (e.g. Buzas & Ayllon, 1981), a parent (e.g., Hart & Risley, 1995)
or a peer (e.g. Ward et al., 1998).

One of the reasons why oral language is acquired so rapidly during the
first four years of life is because the social environment provides all
three of the essential conditions just listed. The young child is
constantly surrounded by models of competent language use as adults talk
with each other and with the child. The child is involved in literally
hundreds of practice trials every day as caretakers and siblings
interact with the child (Hart & Risley, 1995). And the nature of
conversational interactions is such that when the utterances of the
child are comprehensible to others, the conversation proceeds (that is,
comprehensible utterances are reinforced) whereas when the utterances of
the child are not comprehensible the conversation comes to a halt (that
is, incomprehensible utterances are not reinforced).

Note that increasingly competent language responses are reinforced in
many different ways. Let us say, for example, that the child says
"drink". If the request is articulated sufficiently well for the
listener to understand it, the child's attempt to say the word "drink"
is likely to be reinforced with a drink whereas, if the utterance is
only a poor approximation and is not understood, the request may not be
met. The technical term for an utterance which is a request for
something is a "mand". Many of the child\'s earliest language responses
are mands and well formed mands (oral requests) generate reinforcement
every time a caretaker complies with the request.
