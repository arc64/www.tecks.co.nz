# Necessary condition 1: The opportunity to observe models of competent performance

The first condition necessary for the acquisition of a completely new
behaviour is for the learner to be able to observe someone else
performing the behaviour. This is often referred to as the opportunity
to watch a model of the new behaviour. This model may take the form of a
teacher demonstration, the opportunity to observe others performing the
skill in real life, or the opportunity to view a filmed or videotaped
demonstrations of others performing the skill.

There is some debate as to whether or not a model of competent
performance is strictly necessary in order to acquire a new skill. It is
possible to shape completely new behaviours in laboratory animals simply
by differentially reinforcing approximations to the final behaviour and
this suggests that the opportunity to observe a model is not strictly
necessary during the acquisition of new behaviours. On the other hand,
young children who have been completely deprived of models of human
speech (either through severe neglect or as a result of complete
deafness) do not acquire speech (Curtis, 1977; Shaffer, 1989) and this
suggests that listening to models of oral language are necessary for the
development of language. Either way, the learning of new behaviours
occurs so very much more quickly when the learner has a model of the
target behaviour to copy that, for all practical purposes, such models
may be considered a necessary condition for the human learning of new
skills (e.g. Allison, & Ayllon, 1980; Buzas & Ayllon 1981; Fitterling &
Ayllon, 1983).
