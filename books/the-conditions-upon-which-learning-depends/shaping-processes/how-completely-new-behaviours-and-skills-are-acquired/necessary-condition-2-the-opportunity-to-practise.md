The second condition which must be present, if the learner is to acquire
the ability to perform a completely new behaviour, is the opportunity to
practise that behaviour. When the behaviour to be acquired is completely
new, initial attempts to imitate the model only result in approximations
to the final skilled performance. Further improvements require further
practice with improvements being differentially reinforced. In many
cases, extensive amounts of practice are required. Learning to pronounce
correctly all of the English language phonemes requires two to three
years of daily practice. Mastering the basic handwriting skills also
takes several years (although the amount of practice each day is usually
much less than it is for learning to talk). Mastery of a musical
instrument may take six to eight years of daily practice.

Generally speaking, the speed with which new behaviours are acquired is
directly related to the amount of practice engaged in by the learner.
The infant who has many conversations with caregivers each day acquires
the ability to pronounce new words (and an understanding of the meanings
of those words) more quickly than the infant who has few conversations
with caregivers (Hart & Risley, 1995).
