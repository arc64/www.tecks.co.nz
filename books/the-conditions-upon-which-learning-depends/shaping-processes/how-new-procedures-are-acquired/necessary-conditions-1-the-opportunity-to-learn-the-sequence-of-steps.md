When learning a new procedure, the first thing to be learned is the
sequence of steps. This is only possible if each step is somehow
prompted in turn. These sequential prompts may take the form of
demonstrations which show the learner what to do at each step (e.g.,
Blankenship, 1978; Blankenship & Baumgartner, 1982), instructions which
tell the learner what to do (e.g., Joseph & Cooper, 1991; Kameenui,
Carnine, Darch & Stein, 1986), a combination of demonstrations plus
instructions, a permanent model which the learner can refer to (e.g.,
Rivera & Smith, 1987; Smith & Lovitt, 1975) or a demonstration plus a
permanent model (Mercer & Miller, 1992). A demonstration usually
provides a better indication than a verbal description of *how* to
perform each of the component responses. It is also possible for the
student to learn to recite the steps and to use this knowledge to
self-prompt performance of each of the steps in turn (e.g., Montague &
Bos, 1986).

In some cases, the student will also need to learn how to make decisions
about when to perform the next response, or how to make decisions about
which of several options to choose. For example, one of the steps to be
mastered in learning to cook a new recipe is that of deciding when a
dish is cooked so that the next action (removing the dish from the oven
or stove) can be taken. In order to acquire this part of the new skill,
the novice cook may need prompting regarding the stimuli which must be
attended to in order to make this decision accurately (e.g. "Has the
meat come away from the bone?" or "Has it browned enough?" or "Does the
skewer go through without resistance?" or "Has it been boiling for 17
minutes?" and so on).

Although most of the controlled research into prompting has been
undertaken by behavioural scientists (e.g., Wolery, Bailey & Sugai,
1988) the importance of clear prompting is also recognised by cognitive
scientists. "Direct explanation with teacher modelling, helps children
acquire metacognitive knowledge, that is, explicit instruction with
feedback during strategy training is superior to asking students to
infer or abstract a strategy\'s characteristics" (Borkowski &
Muthukrishna, 1992, p. 489).
