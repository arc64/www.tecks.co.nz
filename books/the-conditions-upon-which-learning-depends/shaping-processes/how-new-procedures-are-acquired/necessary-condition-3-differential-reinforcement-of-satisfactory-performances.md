# Necessary condition 3: Differential reinforcement of satisfactory performances

During the initial acquisition phase of learning a new procedure, it is
appropriate to differentially reinforce the successful completion of
each step in turn (e.g., Grimm, Bijou & Parsons, 1973). Once the learner
can perform a step correctly, the reinforcement for that step needs to
be removed so that the acquisition of proficiency is not delayed. Once
the learner can perform the entire procedure, it is satisfactory
completion of the entire procedure which needs to be differentially
reinforced (e.g., Luiselli & Downing, 1980) if independent performance
is to be acquired.

For some procedures (such as finding a book in the library) successful
completion of the procedure will generate its own reinforcement. For
other procedures (such as those required to work particular types of
mathematical problems) reinforcement arises from getting the correct
answer. This means that the exercises which are provided for the
practice of, say, a new maths procedure should be promptly marked so
that satisfactory performance of the new procedure is promptly
reinforced.

For some procedures (such as the procedure for studying from a text
book) satisfactory performance of the procedure may generate no
immediate reinforcement. It may not be until the learner is later tested
on the text book content that the use of a particular study procedure
generates reinforcement for the learner. Continued use of a procedure
which does not generate its own reinforcement is unlikely unless the
learner is reinforced for using the procedure. Without some immediate
reinforcement for using the new procedure, the student\'s use of the
procedure may extinguish (the student may cease to use the procedure).
