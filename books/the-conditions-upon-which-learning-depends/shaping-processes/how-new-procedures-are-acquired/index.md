While some new performances must be laboriously acquired by successive
approximation, others can be acquired simply by combining previously
acquired response elements into new sequences. In this account, skills
which consist of a sequence of responses or steps (where most of the
component responses have already been acquired) are being referred to as
*procedures*. Procedures are also referred to as "operations" and as
"chained tasks". A procedure consists of a sequence of steps or
responses which must be performed in a particular order if the sequence
is to have the desired outcome. Many of the routines which we perform on
a daily basis are procedures. All mathematical operations are
procedures. Compositional writing is a procedure. Most of the skills
which are referred to as "learning strategies" and most of the skills
which are referred to as "meta-cognitive skills" are procedures.

Children are not normally asked to learn a new procedure until they can
perform each of the component responses which go to make up the
procedure. For example, the long multiplication procedure is not usually
taught until the student has mastered single digit multiplication. If
the learner can already perform each of the steps which go to make up a
new procedure, learning the new procedure is a relatively
straight-forward task. It simply involves the learner following a series
of prompts and performing each of the steps in turn. With practice, the
completion of each step will become the cue for beginning the next step
and, with further practice, performance of the entire sequence of steps
becomes automatic.

Assuming that the learner has already acquired the behaviours which will
be needed at each step, acquisition of a new procedure depends upon the
presence of four essential conditions: (a) the learner needs to
experience prompts (scaffolds) which describe what is to be done at each
step, (b) the procedure needs to be practised until prompting is no
longer required, (c) improvements during practice need to be
differentially reinforced, and (d) practice needs to continue until a
functional level of performance fluency has been achieved (Blankenship,
