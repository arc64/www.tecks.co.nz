# Increasing teachers' understanding of learning processes

A number of surveys have found relatively low levels of knowledge about
learning at all levels of the teaching profession. For example, teachers
often leave teacher education programmes with little knowledge of
learning processes apart from that gleaned from a short course on
"theories of learning". These courses tend to treat the various
"theories of learning" as if they were all of equal status even although
the research base for some (e.g. constructivism) is virtually
non-existent while the research base for others (e.g. the principles of
behaviour) is very extensive. A recent and highly regarded discussion of
what teachers need to know (Darling-Hammond & Bransford, 2005) includes
an extended chapter on research on learning. This chapter makes almost
no reference to any of the scientific studies of the various learning
outcomes which teachers are expected to bring about or the teaching
conditions upon which these learning outcomes depend.

The widespread lack of knowledge of basic learning processes exists at
all levels of the school system. Judith Aiken, previous head of the
Education Review Office, reported at a conference on research that
"whenever I am in a school, or meeting principals, deputy principals,
and associate principals, I always make a determined (but polite) effort
to ask about the periodicals and journals to which they and they staff
have access--and actually read. This is usually a very short
conversation" (Aitken, 1997, p. 83). While the school principals
interviewed by Biddle and Saha (2002) were able to point to many
instances of educational research almost none of the examples which they
referred to were examples of scientific research into learning.

In order to move towards an evidence-based profession, one of the first
conditions to be met will be the development of a greatly improved level
of knowledge and understanding of the different types of learning and
the conditions which are necessary for each (Gersten, Chard & Baker,
2000; Grossen, 1996; Walsh, Glaser & Wilcox, 2006; Yates, 2005).
Teachers will need to learn how to distinguish between different types
of learning processes (e.g., attitude change, motivation, acquisition,
and so on), between the various different types of acquisition processes
(e.g., the acquisition of new behaviours, new procedures, new meanings,
new equivalence relations, new conceptual understandings, new knowledge,
and so on), and between the various phases of learning (i.e.
acquisition, independence, mastery, generalisation, application, and so
on). They will need to acquire the ability to recognise the rather
different conditions which are necessary in order for each of these
types of learning to occur (Church, 1999), and they will need to learn
how these conditions can be met in the environment of the classroom.
*Before preservice teachers can acquire these understandings, they will
first need to be acquired by all teacher education lecturers.*

Acquiring these new understandings will not be easy because they will
often conflict with currently held beliefs -- and knowledge which
conflicts with existing beliefs is difficult to acquire (Nuthall &
Alton-Lee, 1993). For example, many teachers and teacher educators
believe in the superior effectiveness of child-centred, enquiry based
and discovery modes of learning which involve only minimal levels of
practice and believe that motivation can be maintained by the use of
interesting activities (Kozloff, 2003). Many teachers and teacher
educators also believe that if children are busy and engaged then they
must be learning (Nuthall, 2007). Large number of teachers still believe
that a failure to learn is a failure on the part of the student and not
a failure on the part of the teacher.

As we shall see in subsequent sections of this website, not only are
these beliefs *not* supported by scientific research, they run directly
*counter* to the results of research -- which consistently reports that
well structured explanations result in the deepest levels of
understanding (e.g., McCleery & Tindal, 2009), that well structured
guidance and scaffolding result in the most rapid learning of new
procedures and processes (e.g., Klahr & Nigam, 2004), that well
structured practice activities with explicit fluency criteria result in
the strongest long term retention (e.g., Ivarie, 1986), that clear goals
and well structured reinforcement (recognition) for goal achievement
result in the highest levels of motivation and liking for learning
(e.g., Sharpe, 1981), and that differences in the prior learning of
specific skills are the major determinant of differences in achievement
(not differences in ability, intelligence, learning style, SES,
ethnicity or culture) (e.g., Nuthall, 2007; Tunmer, Chapman & Prochnow
2006). Discussion of how to distinguish between accurate and erroneous
beliefs about what counts as effective teaching is a discussion which
will be fostered in the final section (Book 9) of this website.

One of the aims of this website is to identify the core knowledge
regarding how and when learning occurs -- the core knowledge that will
be need to be acquired by teacher educators, teachers, and prospective
teachers before we can begin to make the transition from teaching as a
craft to teaching as an evidence-based profession.

Helping teacher education students to understand and distinguish between
the various learning processes and the conditions upon which they depend
will involve a fairly substantial change to teacher education
programmes. No longer will it be possible to leave this aspect of
teacher preparation in the hands of classroom teachers no matter how
expert they may be with respect to classroom teaching. If classroom
teachers are not familiar with the results of scientific research into
the various learning processes, then they will not be qualified to take
teacher education courses in how children learn. "We cannot pass on to a
new generation that which we do not ourselves possess" (Meier, 1992, p
59).

We will know that the transition to evidence-based practice has begun
when we see teacher education programmes hiring specialists in
children's learning to teach the next generation of teachers about the
conditions upon which learning depends. The design of these new courses
in learning will require a collaborative effort involving PhD qualified
lecturers who have specialised in child development, in basic learning
processes, in behaviour analysis, in metacognitive processes, and in the
emerging research into how the brain works. These courses will also need
to be sufficiently extensive to allow time for beliefs to change.
Otherwise the cognitive conflict engendered by the new knowledge will
not result in a change in beliefs about how learning occurs. It will
result in a rejection of the hard won scientific knowledge.
