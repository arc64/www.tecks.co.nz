The primary function of teacher education at the present time is
cultural transmission, that is, ensuring that the classroom practices of
the current generation of teachers and their beliefs about teaching are
passed on to the next generation of teachers. We know that this is so
when we compare transcripts of classroom lessons which were recorded in
the early 1960s and find that they are identical in format and content
to classroom lessons recorded 40 years later (Nuthall, 2007). We know
that this is so when we compare the teaching and classroom management
skills of teachers who graduated 20 years ago and find that they are
identical to those observed 20 years later (Shearer, 1999).

Nor should we be surprised by this observation. Classroom practice is
initially learned during the 13,000 hours of observational learning
which occur during 12 years of schooling. The teaching behaviours and
beliefs about teaching which are acquired during this initial 13,000
hours of classroom observation are well established prior to entry to
any teacher education programme and, in most cases, are little changed
by that programme (Meier, 1992; Kennedy, 1991; Richardson & Placier,
2002).

Secondly, new teachers quickly develop the decision making skills,
management skills, and teaching skills which are needed for survival as
a classroom teacher. Because these decision making skills, management
skills and teaching skills are used dozens of time every day they
quickly become automatic and, because they are highly automaticised,
they quickly become extremely resistant to change.

Thirdly, classroom teaching occurs in a culture, the culture of the
school. Cultures operate to maintain consistency and continuity. A new
teacher who tries to introduce some radical new classroom practice may
find it hard to continue behaving differently in the face of unconcealed
disapproval from colleagues and supervisors.

For these reasons and others, changes to teaching practice are difficult
to achieve and even when achieved are difficult to maintain (Evertson &
Randolf, 1989). Simply telling teachers about the results of research or
about new and more effective practices does not result in changes in
practice (Henderson, 1982; Sykes, 1999; Timperley, Wilson, Barrar &
Fung, 2007). Teachers are not required to demonstrate their ability to
produce learning in a range of different types of learners in order to
register as a teacher or to remain registered (Stone, 2002). Because no
child ever dies as a result of ineffective teaching, there is no ethical
imperative to change.

Evidence-based practice, in contrast, is not just about cultural
transmission. It is also about improvement. It opens up the possibility
that teacher educators might begin to engage in research which results
in the invention of new kinds of classroom practice -- practices which
result in increasing numbers of children leaving school with the skills
which they require for a productive life in the 21st century.

If such improvement is to occur, teacher educators will have a pivotal
role to play in bringing this about.

At the moment much of the content of teacher education courses is
justified by reference to notions with little or no research base --
notions such learning styles, developmentally appropriate practice,
constructivism, discovery learning, the classroom as a learning
community, and so on. If there is to be a move to evidence based
practice, then teacher educators will need to look more closely at what
they are teaching and begin the task of progressively introducing, into
their courses, those theories and practices which have the strongest
research support (Grosson, 1996; Kozloff, 2003; Stone, 2002). Now that
teacher education programmes in New Zealand have all been moved into
universities this task can proceed quite rapidly. This is because the
intellectual and scientific resources of a university are so much
greater than the resources of a stand-alone college of education.

At the moment much of the research undertaken by teacher educators
involves the seemingly endless description of current practices and
beliefs using small scale, qualitative methodologies (Richardson, 2002).
If there is to be a move to evidence-based practice then significant
numbers of teacher educators will need to begin the move into research
and development activities, instructional design work, and the
development of educative curriculum materials and this movement will
need to continue until we have created a critical mass of teacher
educators who are working on scientifically oriented R & D activities
(Burkhardt & Schoenfeld, 2003; Davis & Krajcik, 2005; Layng,
Stikeleather & Twyman, 2004; Slavin, 2005). Undertaken within the
context of teacher education programmes, the scientific development and
evaluation tasks can proceed quite rapidly. This is because the
evaluation of short units of work can be undertaken by building these
into the professional practice requirements of entire cohorts of several
hundred teacher education students on an annual basis.

In addition to the scientific development of effective teaching
materials, activities and programmes, other types of scientifically
oriented research work will also be required -- scientific
investigations into how best to meet the learning needs of different
groups of learners at each age level, the development of reliable
procedures for monitoring the learning of individual students in the
classroom, the scientific evaluation of current teaching and behaviour
management procedures, and the development of materials and practices
which produce improved rates of progress in children with different
types of special teaching needs (Raudenbush, 2005).

We will know that the move towards evidence-based practice has begun
when we see substantial numbers of teacher educators engaged in these
kinds of research activities, when we see the results of these research
activities integrated into our teacher education courses and when we see
the graduates of those programmes continuing to use these research based
materials and procedures in their classrooms in the years following
their registration as teachers.
