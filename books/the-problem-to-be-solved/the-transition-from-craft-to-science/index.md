# The transition from craft to science

Discovering that there is a very considerable tradition of scientific
research in child development, in basic learning processes, and in the
relative effectiveness of many commonly used teaching procedures does
not mean that the transition from craft to science in teaching practice
has begun or will now begin. The change from craft to science in medical
practice required the presence of a number of social conditions and took
the better part of 70 years. [A similar transition]{.external-link} in
teaching practice is likely to take a similar amount of time and is
unlikely to occur until certain conditions are met. Some of the
conditions which appear to be necessary for a transition from craft to
scientific practice in classroom teaching include the following.

-   A more detailed knowledge by teachers of the conditions on which
    different types of learning depend.
-   A more detailed understanding by both teachers and researchers of
    the complexities of classroom practice.
-   A greater understanding of teachers' beliefs about teaching and the
    way in which these beliefs constrain the changes which are possible.
-   A more widespread recognition of the nature of teachers' work and
    the way in which this limits the kinds of changes which are
    possible.
-   A greater recognition of the fact that teacher education has the
    potential to improve teaching practice.
-   Recognition of the fact that a move to evidence based practice will
    require a very much greater research effort than is currently
    occurring.
-   Recognition of the fact that progress will depend upon research of a
    much higher quality that that which is currently being undertaken.

In this section we examine each of these conditions and the likelihood
that they will occur in the New Zealand setting.
