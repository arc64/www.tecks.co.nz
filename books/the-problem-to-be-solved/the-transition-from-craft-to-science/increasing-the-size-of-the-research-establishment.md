During the past 30 years, a small band of researchers have made a strong
start on the development of a science of learning and teaching and this
augers well for the transition to evidence-based practice. However the
research completed to date is only the very beginning of the work which
needs to done. Much more research will be required to complete the
analysis of learning processes and the conditions which they require, to
develop a comprehensive technology of instructional design, and to
develop a complete set of evidence-based teaching materials and
practices for 13 years of compulsory schooling.

However, the number of researchers available to pursue this goal is
tiny. According to the Tertiary Education Commission (2004a), New
Zealand has approximately 280 people actively engaged in educational
research. Given that there are more than 48,000 primary and secondary
teachers alone, it can be seen that well under half a per cent of the
teaching workforce is engaged in research.

Funding for educational research is also miniscule. Working from OECD
figures, Alton Lee (2004, p. 6) reported that the level of R & D funding
in education is probably somewhere between 0.17% and 0.2% of the total
education budget. This is well below the amount spent in other OECD
countries for which data is available. The under-funding of research in
education is a problem of long standing (Whitcombe, 1985).

Note that the very low percentage of the sector involved in research and
the very low level of investment in research (compared to say the health
sector) is not just a New Zealand phenomenon. It exists across the
Western World (Burkhardt & Schoenfeld, 2003; Keeves & McKenzie, 1999).

Not only is the research establishment very small given the size of the
sector, it is not particularly productive. The first assessment, in
2003, by the Tertiary Education Commission for the Performance-Based
Research Fund provided a reasonably detailed picture of the number of
research active staff in each of New Zealand's teacher education
programmes. The PBRF exercise revealed that the majority of New
Zealand's teacher educators were not active educational researchers
(Tertiary Education Commission, 2004a, 2004b). Altogether only 27% of
New Zealand's tertiary education teachers submitted research portfolios
containing sufficient research to qualify them for an A, B, or C rating
(Alcorn et al., 2004). The comparable figures for some of the individual
universities and colleges were as follows: University of Auckland School
of Education: 77%, University of Canterbury School of Education: 62%,
University of Waikato School of Education: 43%, Auckland College of
Education 14% and Christchurch College of Education 9.4% (Tertiary
Education Commission, 2004a). (The recent amalgamation of the Colleges
of Education and the Universities at Auckland, Christchurch and Dunedin
will change these figures.).

Not only are educational researchers small in number but they have to
cover a range of disciplines. Faculties of Education traditionally
include specialists in educational philosophy, educational history,
educational sociology, educational psychology, assessment, human
development, human learning, curriculum studies, methods of teaching,
professional studies, and so on. This further reduces the number of
researchers working on questions relating to learning, teaching, and
teacher education.

How, then, is the research capacity which will be needed for the
transition to evidence-based practice to be created? There are three
main avenues of recruitment into educational research, recruitment from
teacher educators, recruitment from research students, and recruitment
from the teaching profession. To make the transition we will need to
recruit from all three of these sources.

**Increasing the number of teacher educators who are engaged in
research**

Teacher educators have shown a keen interest in becoming involved in
research. As the various New Zealand colleges of education have merged
with their local universities, the membership of the New Zealand
Association for Research in Education has climbed steadily and
membership has more than doubled. However, at we will see below, it is
not easy for a teacher educator who has been recruited from the teaching
profession to become involved in research. This is because they have not
been trained as researchers and because their primary interest is not in
research but in the practice of teaching (Labaree, 2004).

In order to increase the numbers of teacher educators engaged in
research it will be necessary to pursue a number of policies. These
include increased funding for research within the new university based
colleges and faculties of education, increased funding for professional
development leave for those who have been appointed with masters degrees
so that they can upgrade to PhD degrees, and policies which ensure that,
when retirements occur, these retirees are replaced by lecturers with
PhD level qualifications in research as well as professional
qualifications in teaching.

**Increasing the number of education students who are engaged in
research**

Up until very recently, the majority of New Zealand education students
who completed a masters level qualification did so without completing a
research thesis and even those who did complete a thesis tended to study
questions which could be addressed using a relatively unsophisticated
descriptive methodology. Unfortunately these descriptive research
projects add nothing to the scientific knowledge base. Nor do they
prepare students for further research which might generate new
scientific knowledge regarding learning or teaching processes. As we
shall see below, there are good reasons for this, one of which is the
lack of research methods training at the undergraduate level in our
current teacher education programmes.

In order to recruit postgraduate education students into research it
will be necessary to pursue policies which differ from those which are
currently being pursued. For example, we will need to upgrade research
methods training at the undergraduate level so that advanced research
methods training can be undertaken at the postgraduate level and we will
need to upgrade research methods training at the postgraduate level so
that masters students and PhD students who wish to engage in scientific
research into learning and/or teaching have the knowledge and skills
which they will need for this kind of research. We will also need to
encourage masters levels students to complete research theses and to
make it clear to masters students that, if they are hoping eventually to
become teacher educators, they will need to have completed a masters
thesis in order to gain entry to the PhD programme which will qualify
them for university positions in teacher education.

**Increasing the number of teachers who are engaged in research**

Increasing the numbers of teacher educators and post-graduate students
who are working on scientifically oriented research and development
activities will increase the research establishment to a limited extent
but certainly not to the extent required for the transition to
evidence-based practice. The only way of greatly increasing the number
of people engaged in research on teaching relative to the number of
people engaged in the practice of teaching is by making it possible for
teachers themselves to contribute to the research enterprise. This is
what happened during the move to evidence-based practice in medicine 80
years ago and there are no practical impediments to the same thing
happening in education.

What is being suggested here is a greatly accelerated development in
what has come to be known as "practitioner research". Unfortunately
practitioner research has all too often been conceptualised as "action
research" and other types of relatively simple-minded descriptive and
narrative accounts of elements of classroom culture and practice (e.g.,
Anderson, 2002; Hollingsworth, 1999). This is not what is being
suggested. What is being suggested is practitioner research which takes
the form of scientifically oriented research on teaching, that is,
experimental analyses of learning and teaching processes of individual
children in the classroom.

Is this possible? It certainly is. At the University of Canterbury,
teachers and allied professionals have completed several hundred
experimental analyses of learning processes, management procedures,
motivational procedures, instructional procedures, and remedial teaching
procedures. As a result of this work we have discovered that most
teachers, when given the necessary teaching or mentoring, are quite
capable of scientifically oriented practitioner research where they
measure the effectiveness of what they are doing or seek to discover new
and more effective classroom practices (Church, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1986,
1990, 1996).

As this website develops we will post, in Book 8 of this website,
examples of scientifically oriented practitioner studies of learning and
teaching which have been completed by classroom teachers at both the
undergraduate and postgraduate levels so that practising teachers and
teachers in training can see the contribution which they could be making
to the scientific development of improvements in classroom practice.
