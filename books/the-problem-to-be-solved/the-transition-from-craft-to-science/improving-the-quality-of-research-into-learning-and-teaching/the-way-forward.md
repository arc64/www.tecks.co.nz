In this introduction to the TECKS website we have reviewed the current
state of classroom practice and have concluded that it remains a craft
largely untouched by the scientific research into learning and teaching.
When teachers need to solve an instructional problem, they "consult the
teacher down the hall". They do not consult the scientific research into
solutions for that particular problem (Landrum & Tankersley, 2004).

We have also reviewed the current state of research in education and
have concluded (a) that it is grossly understaffed and underfunded
(given the amount which is spent on education), and (b) that teaching
and learning researchers are spending far too much of their precious
time engaged in tediously uninformative, small scale, descriptive
studies of "what is" rather than exploring, experimentally, "what might
be". It is also clear that the scientific research which could possibly
be used to inform practice, is largely invisible because it is buried
under a mountain of pre-scientific research.

However, we remain optimistic. We believe that progressive improvements
in teaching practice, fuelled by scientific research into learning,
teaching and instructional design are possible during the 21st century
in the same way that progressive improvements in medical practice proved
to be possible during the 20th century. "Educational research has
reached the point, unimaginable a mere 25 years ago, where it is now
possible to conduct fundamental research amidst principled attempts to
affect practice for the better" (Burkhardt & Shoenfeld, 2003, p. 7).

This optimism is based on a number of recent developments.

The first is the emergence of a small group of educational researchers
(the behaviour analysts) who have made the transition from
pre-scientific to scientific modes of inquiry and are already hard at
work identifying the conditions which govern behaviour change, learning
and teaching effectiveness (e.g., Greer, 1983; Heward & Cooper, 1992).

The second is the development over the last two decades of an increasing
number of evidence-based and demonstrably effective teaching programmes
for children with unrealistic fears and phobias, children with attention
problems, children with antisocial behaviour problems, children with
language delays, children with reading delays and learning disabilities,
children with autism and intellectual disabilities, and so on (e.g.,
Mash & Barkley, 2006). If we can design teaching procedures which
accelerate the development of our most difficult-to-teach children, then
we can certainly do the same for the rest of the school population.

Thirdly, we have learned how to record those changes which we refer to
as learning and how to measure the effects of teaching variables on
learning (Church, 1996; Cooper, Heron & Heward, 2007), we have learned
how to distinguish between research procedures which do and do not
produce reproducible results and we have learned how to use this
knowledge to produce literature reviews from which reliable conclusions
can be drawn (e.g., Church, 2003; Timperley, Wilson, Barrar & Fung,
2007).

Fourthly, Departments and Ministries of Education across the Western
world are beginning to insist that those researchers who work in the
areas of learning, teaching and teacher education begin to concentrate
their efforts on the development and dissemination of evidence-based
materials and procedures, that is, on those teaching practices and
programmes which are known (from well designed empirical evaluations) to
have desired effects on learning and achievement -- especially the
learning and achievement of low achieving children (Alton-Lee, 2004;
U.S. Department of Education, 2002). Researchers are now beginning to
recognise also that teacher educators "are at the nexus of research and
practice in education" (Landrum & Tankersley, 204, pp. 210) and will
therefore play a critical role in determining what is important as well
as what is effective.

Fifthly, increasing numbers of leading researchers are beginning to
recognise that some questions about learning and teaching are more
important than others, that different kinds of questions require
different kinds of research methods if they are to be answered, that
when it comes to evaluating the effects of different teaching practices
we need a set of research methods which "rule things in and rule things
out" and that, while not perfect, the scientific methods are the best
procedures that we have for this purpose at this time (e.g. Berninger,
Dunn, Lin & Shimada, 2004; Carnine, 2000; Chall, 2002; Eisenhart &
DeHaan, 2005; Feuer, Towne & Shavelson 2002; Greenwood, 2001; Grossen,
1996; Landrum & Tankersley, 2004; Raudenbush, 2005; Ravitch, 2000;
Reyna, 2004; Slavin, 2002; Wheldall, 2005).

The sixth and most encouraging sign of all is the appearance of attempts
to sketch out the kinds of educational policies which will be needed in
order to begin the transition from craft-based to evidence-based
practice (e.g., Burkhardt & Schoenfeld, 2003; Carnine, 2000; Greenwood,
2001; Raudenbush, 2005; Slavin, 2005).

Stephen Raudenbush argues that the number one question which is being
asked by policy makers is the question of how we can improve classroom
teaching and learning. This includes questions about the interventions
which show the most promise, and the procedures to be used in
identifying these. "It follows that identifying, testing, and warranting
the effectiveness of strategies for instruction is currently the central
task of applied research in education" (Raudenbush, 2005, p. 27).
Raudenbush also reminds us that, in order to accomplish this goal,
researchers will also need to undertake descriptive studies designed to
identify the best ways of measuring different types of learning,
epidemiological (correlational) studies designed to find out which
students are having difficulties with which learning outcomes in which
contexts, large numbers of single case experiments designed to identify
promising interventions, to identify which children these work for, and
to identify the conditions under which these interventions do and do not
work, and descriptive studies of what happens when teachers try to
implement these more effective practices in different contexts.

Burkhardt & Schoenfeld (2003) identify some of the key policy changes
which will be required for the transition to evidence-based practice.
These include the development of standard measures of learning (so that
results can be compared across studies), the development of a standard
terminology (so that researchers can communicate with instructional
designers and other research teams), the development of research
programmes (so that research evidence begins to build cumulatively with
time), funding policies which result in the development of larger teams
(so that it becomes possible to upscale effective procedures from
demonstration experiments to widespread implementation trials),
increased funding of "design experiments" which contribute both to our
knowledge of the conditions necessary for learning and the development
of more effective teaching materials and procedures, and greatly
improved training of educational researchers in the full range of
research skills which are required for successful R & D work. Burkhardt
and Schoenfeld point to the negligible funding for medical research at
the turn of the 20th century and the way successive research-led
developments in medical practice led to successive increases in research
funding to remind educational researchers of the advantages of
investment in research programmes which result in the development of
more effective teaching materials and procedures.

Robert Slavin who directed the development of "Success for All" (the
highly effective junior school programme) argues that we need to greatly
increase expenditure on the development, evaluation and dissemination of
effective instructional programmes and materials (Slavin, 2005). This,
he argues, should include the funding of "design competitions" in which
developers are challenged to create more effective programmes to teach
reading, maths, science, social studies, and so on across each grade
level as well as the funding of independent third-party randomised
groups evaluations of current and new educational programs and
practices. Schools should receive financial incentives for participating
in programme evaluations and other types of research and for adopting
teaching programmes which have already been shown to be effective.
Slavin, too, is confident that "when policymakers perceive that
educational research and development is actually producing programs that
are shown in rigorous experiments to improve student outcomes, they will
fund research at far higher levels" (Slavin, 2002, p. 15).

Only if we can overcome our obsession with endlessly describing what is,
and begin to divert a major part of our research funding towards
studying what might be, and to do this in a scientific manner, can we
begin the journey towards classroom practices which will enable every
child to develop to the fullest extent possible. The aim of this website
is to show that this journey has already begun. Thirty years ago, Robert
Glaser (1967) predicted that we were about to witness the emergence of a
science of instruction and a technology of instructional design. This
didn't happen in his lifetime. Perhaps it will in yours.
