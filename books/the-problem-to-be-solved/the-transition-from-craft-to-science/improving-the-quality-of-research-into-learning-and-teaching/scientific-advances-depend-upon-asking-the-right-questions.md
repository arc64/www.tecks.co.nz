In order for a field to advance, the researchers in that field must be
in a position to ask worthwhile questions and to distinguish between
questions which are worth studying and those which are not. A huge
amount of educational research addresses trivial questions, questions
which practitioners already know the answer to, questions which could
easily be answered by a journalist following a few well placed phone
calls, and questions which can be answered simply by reviewing the
results of previous research. For example, educational researchers had
demonstrated by the 1960s that effective teaching procedures cannot be
identified by interviewing the students or supervisors of teachers who
have been judged by their peers to be effective teachers (Medley, 1972).
Yet investigations of this type continue to be funded even to the
present day (e.g. Hill & Hawk, 2000).

Why do teacher educators continue to study trivial questions? Labaree
(2004) identifies several reasons: the fact that research into learning
and teaching is a difficult field to work in, the fact that teacher
educators are mostly recruited from the teaching profession, and the
fact that teacher educators typically come to research mid career. In
addition, we are not requiring novice researchers to study and master
the understandings which have already been acquired as a result of
previous research.

**The field of learning and teaching is a difficult field to work in**

The field of educational research, with its many different disciplines,
is a field of very considerable epistemological and social complexity
(Labaree, 2004). Berliner (2002) refers to it as "the hardest science of
all." This means that "doing good research is difficult, expensive, and
time consuming" (Landrum & Tankersley, 2004, p. 210).

There are many differences between the research undertaken in faculties
of education and the research undertaken in faculties of science,
medicine, engineering and so on. One of the characteristics of the
established sciences is that, at any particular stage in the development
of the science everyone is focused on solving problems at the same level
(Becher, 1989). This is not the case in education where research is
forever starting again at ground level. "Researchers cannot build ... on
the foundations laid by others because these foundations are always
being reconstructed. As a result, research work is spread thinly over a
wide area, as individuals and groups continually work at rethinking the
most basic issues in the field and as they each pursue their own
interpretive approaches" (Labaree, 2004, p. 71).

One of the characteristics of the established sciences is that they have
developed a set of established research procedures of known reliability
and there is a consensus across the discipline that these are the
methods which should be used (Kuhn, 1970). This is not the case in
education where the methods used by teacher educators are almost
universally pre-scientific and there is no agreement regarding how even
key elements of the subject matter (learning and teaching) should be
categorised, quantified, measured or analysed (Church, 1997, 1998).

One of the characteristics of the established sciences is that the
results of research are cumulative. This is not the case in education
where researchers are forever reinventing the wheel and then critiquing
it until it is no longer fashionable. Nowhere is this more obvious than
in the so called "qualitative" inquiry of the past 30 years -- a huge
research effort which has produced not a single textbook of new
understandings with respect to how children learn or how they might best
be taught.

One of the characteristics of the established sciences, is that it takes
a long time to train and induct new researchers because there is so much
to learn not only about the methods of research but also about what has
been discovered already. This is not the case in education where, in
general, novices are inducted quickly because the field is wide open,
all issues are open for investigation and almost any method of inquiry
has its devotees. Researchers feel free to charge off in all directions
without worrying about the stage of development reached by previous
investigators. "They constantly re-examine old questions and reconstruct
existing theories" (Labaree, 2004, p. 71).

**Teacher educators are recruited from the ranks of the teaching
profession**

In New Zealand, as in other Western countries, the great majority of
teacher educators are recruited from schools and not from graduate
schools (Labaree, 2004). However, pre-service teacher education
programmes typically involve little contact with research. In addition,
most classroom teachers view research as a matter of only peripheral
importance as far as teaching is concerned (Floden, 2006). This view is
reinforced in many ways: not only by the absence of scientific research
in our teacher education programmes, by also by the pretentiousness and
poor quality of much educational research and by the fact that much, if
not most, educational research fails to address the questions about
learning, teaching, and behaviour management which are central to the
role of the classroom teacher. What this means is that teachers who take
up positions as teacher educators are often ill-equipped for the
research which is expected of them in a university environment and even
less well equipped to teach others the question asking and
methodological skills necessary for worthwhile research.

An examination of the careers of educational researchers who have chosen
a scientific approach to the study of learning and teaching indicates
that preparing for such a career requires 5 to 6 years of carefully
chosen preparation. This is because it takes several years to master
essential research skills such as the ability to design reliable
measures of learning and achievement, the ability to design experimental
measures of the effects of teaching variables on learning in individual
children, the ability to design epidemiological studies and the ability
to design randomised groups evaluations of teaching programmes. It also
takes more than a year to master the basic statistical techniques which
are involved in interpreting the results of epidemiological studies and
randomised groups evaluations. In addition it takes several years to
acquire an understanding of the knowledge base (e.g. of the research on
learning, or the research on teaching) sufficient to enable one to
distinguish between research questions which are and are not worthwhile.
And it takes at least three years to complete practical requirements,
that is, the masters and doctoral level research projects which provide
access to university level teaching positions.

*However, most teacher educators come to research mid-career.* Because
there is little or no training in or exposure to research during the
teacher's first degree studies, the teacher educator's first exposure to
research typically occurs at the masters level. Unlike first degree
studies, masters level studies are typically undertaken part time while
continuing to work. This means that there is little time for lengthy
reflection, for following up on interesting ideas and research leads, or
for catching up on the academic study which was impossible during the
first degree studies.

All too often the masters level study is seen simply as a means to
promotion and not as the programme of study in which research skills
will be acquired and practised, methodological debates dissected and
analysed, and a field of research selected for one's research career.
"The vast majority of postgraduate students are part-time and full-time
in their professional commitments. This means that their undertaking
research courses as part of their obtaining a higher degree provides
them with a modicum of research capability and the ability to critique
research rather than a substantive research competency" (Findsen, 2001,
p. 7). In fact the majority of masters degrees undertaken by New Zealand
teachers until very recently contained no supervised research component
at all. A majority of the students who have completed the UC MEd and the
CCE MTchLn degrees during the past decade have done so without
completing a research thesis.

The PhD studies completed by teacher educators are often completed under
similar conditions (Labaree, 2004; Middleton, 2001). Teacher educators
who elect to study for a PhD tend to do so mid career and part time
while continuing to work. "The reason for education as a subject doing
poorly in the PBRF rankings was that most staff were in their second or
third careers. People often started their academic careers at 34, or 40,
and sometimes later" (Nixon, 2004). Many teacher educators come to PhD
studies with little or no undergraduate preparation in research and, in
many cases, minimal masters level preparation in research. Because PhD
study is being undertaken while continuing to work there simply is not
time to do the background reading necessary to bring oneself up to date
with respect to previous research in the field. At the same time, the
new academic's lack of prior research training and experience severely
limits their ability to distinguish between worthwhile and trivial lines
of inquiry or to catch up on missing methods skills and methodological
knowledge (Eisenhart & DeHaan, 2005; Labaree, 2004).

This means that the new teacher education lecturer is almost always
ill-prepared for a research career -- especially when compared to
recently graduated PhDs in engineering, medicine, law, clinical
psychology, and so on. While members of the science departments start
their research careers as soon as they are qualified, members of
education departments, by and large, start their research careers only
after a number of years in the classroom.

Teacher educators who are moving from the classroom to a career which
includes research face significant sources of cognitive conflict.
Several of these sources of conflict have been described by Labaree
(2003, 2004). One of the features of advanced research training is
instruction in learning how to be critical, how to identify and question
underlying assumptions and cultural beliefs, and how to examine the
effectiveness of even well established practices. Teachers who enter
doctoral programmes often misinterpret the critical approach to teaching
as an attack on their role, their practice, and their core beliefs. Some
try to handle this cognitive conflict by avoiding engagement with this
part of their training with the result that they fail to acquire the
critical attitude which is an essential prerequisite for a successful
research career. Others attempt to handle this cognitive conflict by
redefining research to include low level descriptive and interpretive
accounts of the teaching and professional development activities in
which they are already engaged. This kind of activity is easy to spot.
It is variously referred to as "teacher research", "action research", or
"practitioner research" (Darling-Hammond, Hammerness, Grossman, Rust &
Shulman, 2005).

**Is the awful reputation of educational research justified?**

While educational researchers cherish the freedom to study anything they
want using whatever methods they feel like, this has a very serious
downside. It means that much educational research has studied trivial
questions and has, has a result, generated trivial knowledge; much
educational research has used weak research designs and has, as a
result, generated ungeneralisable knowledge, and much research has been
driven by sloppy thinking and has, as a result, generated knowledge with
no explanatory power and hence no enduring qualities.

Because teacher educators have frequently pursued trivial questions
using pre-scientific research methods they have largely failed to
advance our understanding of the conditions under which different kinds
of learning occur. This knowledge has been collected by researchers
working in schools of psychology and in the academic sections (not the
teacher education sections) of schools of education. Teacher educators
have also failed to collect reliable data on the relative effectiveness
and efficiency of different ways of teaching different kinds of skills
and understandings, or to discover effective ways of teaching children
with different kinds of special teaching needs, or to identify those
practices which will ensure that all children master the skills and
understandings specified in the national curriculum.

Given the central role which teacher educators have to play in these
areas, this avoidance behaviour amounts to a very serious waste of time
and effort. This has not gone unnoticed by those both inside and outside
the profession (e.g. Carnine, 2000; Chall, 2002; Greenwood, 2001;
Grossen, 1996; Nuthall, 2001; Meyer, 2002; Ravitch, 1998; Walsh, 2006).
"Until we do longitudinal research on which approaches do in fact result
in raising student achievement and reducing disparities, we are simply
engaging in superstitious behaviour" (Meyer, 2002).
