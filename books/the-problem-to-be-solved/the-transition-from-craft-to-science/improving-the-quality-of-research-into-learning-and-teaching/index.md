For far too long educational research has had an "awful" reputation
(Kaestle, 1993). In part, this reputation is justified. Large swathes of
educational research are, in fact, awful -- or at least of little value.
Consider, for example, the thousands of studies which have used
between-group designs to study learning -- a phenomenon which actually
occurs in individuals, or the hundreds of studies which have used
ethnographic and other kinds of descriptive methods to study the
relationship between teaching and learning -- even although
relationships cannot be identified using a descriptive method (Reyna,
2004; Robinson et al., 2007).

The move to evidence-based teaching practice will require a very great
increase in the amount of research completed. But this cannot be
achieved simply by increasing the number of researchers. An increase in
the number of educational researchers might simply increase the amount
of "awful" research being undertaken.

What we have to achieve is not only to increase the number of education
lecturers, teacher education lecturers and teachers who are engaged in
research into learning and teaching but also to greatly increase the
proportion of these who are engaged in high quality, scientifically
oriented research which could, conceivably, produce improvements in our
understanding of learning and teaching processes. In order to accomplish
this we must first understand why so much of the research into learning
and teaching is of so little value and then identify policies and
practices which are likely to result in substantial improvements in
research quality.
