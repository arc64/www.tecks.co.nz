Some generalisations about the effects of a given teaching practice on
learning have no research support, some are supported by the results of
a single scientific investigation and some are supported by the results
of many scientific investigations by different teams of researchers.
Figure 1136 illustrates this continuum using the example of research
into a particular functional relationship, say the arrangement of
positive and negative examples of a new concept during an explanation
and the degree of conceptual understanding which results from the
explanation.

relationship exists between some aspect of teaching and some aspect of
learning (Graphic adapted from Martens & Eckert,

Because a generalisation about pedagogical effects may be supported by
the result of anything from one to a large number of controlled
investigations this raises the question of how many times a research
finding result needs to be replicated before it is admitted to the
research base for a particular teaching practice.

Teaching researchers have engaged in little discussion concerning the
amount of empirical evidence which would be required in order to justify
a claim that a given practice qualified as "evidence-based". The
standard adopted by clinical child psychologists is that a particular
intervention may be classified as "well established" provided two or
more separate research teams have found the intervention to be more
effective than a placebo treatment using well controlled clinical
trials, *or* if 10 or more well designed single-case experiments have
shown the intervention to be more effective than some other intervention
(Lonigan, Elbert & Johnson, 1998).

Two clinical trials seems a very low standard of proof (Fonagy, Target,
Cottrell, Phillips & Kurtz, 2002) but is certainly an improvement over
the current situation in education where effectiveness claims are often
being made on the basis of a single investigation (e.g., Alton Lee,
2003; Anthony & Walshaw, 2007).
