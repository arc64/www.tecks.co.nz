# Calls for increased accountability

Another source of calls for change is the accountability movement. These
calls are based on the simple idea that those responsible for education
should "set . . . goals, measure whether or not they have been met, do
something about it if they haven't" (Torrance, 2002, p. 1).

The implementation of the standards movement in the UK, has been
described by Torrance (1997, 2002). Torrance argues that the movement
was based on four assumptions. These were

-   that agreement can be reached on national educational aims and
    specific curricular objectives
-   that these can be expressed in traditional subject-specific
    programmes of study
-   that tests can be devised which validly assess such objectives and
    accurately represent pupil attainment of them, and
-   that setting targets, publishing results and constantly pressing for
    increases in scores will both raise standards and provide evidence
    of these rising standards.

Similar systems have been introduced in a number of US states
(Darling-Hammond, 2004). In 2010 the New Zealand government decided to
introduce a national standards system into New Zealand primary schools.

The introduction of these standards-based reforms, and the huge
expenditure which these have involved, is further evidence that parents
and politicians are becoming increasingly concerned about the apparent
lack of progress which is being made in developing more effective forms
of classroom practice.
