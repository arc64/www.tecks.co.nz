A number of writers have described the cyclical pattern of "innovation"
in education as "faddism".

"Imagine the outcry if new miracle wonder drugs were released to an
unsuspecting public without extensive, experimental clinical trials
testifying to their efficacy. But in education, this is precisely what
typically happens. And so we see them pass, fad after fad, guru
following guru, educational disaster after educational disaster. The
result is that in education we do not make progress, we merely see
changes of fashion" (Wheldall, 2005, pp. 579-580).

"The story of educational innovation over the long run is a depressing
one. Most innovations adopted on a large scale were never adequately
evaluated . . . . Most often, innovations that have been
enthusiastically adopted and even found to be effective in particular
schools are later dropped, sometimes to be replaced by other innovations
and sometimes for a return to the status quo ante. The reasons for this
boom-to-bust cycle in innovation are all too familiar (see Slavin, 1989,
1999). In any area of endeavor ruled by fashion rather than by evidence,
such as art, music, design, and haute couture, novelty is prized and no
fad or trend can last for many years. Unfortunately innovation in
education far more closely resembles faddism in these areas than the
generational progress based on evidence characteristic of such fields as
medicine, applied physics or engineering" (Slavin, 2004, p. 61).

For Wheldall and for Slavin, the only way to halt the pendulum of
faddish innovation is to change the ground rules for selecting,
implementing and evaluating innovations in teaching. Such innovations
must be limited, they argue, to changes which have been rigorously
evaluated, which have been shown to be more effective than current
practice, which are supported by well developed curriculum materials and
which are supported by a commitment to long term funding, research, and
professional development support (Slavin, 1989).
