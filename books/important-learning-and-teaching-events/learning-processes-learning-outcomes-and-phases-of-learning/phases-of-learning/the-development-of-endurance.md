Some skills are still not functional even although they can be performed
at functional levels of fluency for short periods of time. For example,
it is not sufficient that a child be able to keep up with the rest of
the orchestra for a minute or two. The child must be able to keep up
with the rest of the orchestra for the entire performance and this may
last for 20 minutes or more.

Being able to maintain a given level off fluency for a reasonable period
of time is referred to as *endurance*. The endurance building phase of
learning covers that period of time from when the learner begins to
respond with functional levels of fluency through to when they are able
to demonstrate that they can respond with functional levels of fluency
for functional periods of time. Endurance is a commonly used measure of
achievement in such skills as keyboarding. Instead of using a 1 minute
fluency test, the instructor measures fluency over a longer period such
as 10 minutes.
