# The generalisation of skills to new situations

There are many situations where the desired learning outcome is to learn
*when* a particular response, behaviour or operation should be used.
This often involves teaching the learner to generalise across those
situations in which the response is appropriate and to discriminate
between those situations in which the response is appropriate and those
situations where it is not. Having taught someone how to draw money from
an automatic teller machine, we expect this skill to generalise to the
various different kinds of automatic tellers. Having taught a child how
to find a word in a dictionary, we expect the child to generalise this
skill to other dictionaries and indexes which are arranged
alphabetically. Having taught a child how to solve a particular type of
maths problem, we expect the child's problem solving to generalise to
other examples of that type of problem.

The technical term for the development of these kinds of performances is
"stimulus generalisation." It is also referred to as "transfer" -- as in
the ability to transfer a previously learned skill to a new situation.
Although the ability to generalise skills to new situation is clearly an
important kind of learning outcome, agreed procedures for measuring
changes in the degree of stimulus generalisation have yet to be
developed.
