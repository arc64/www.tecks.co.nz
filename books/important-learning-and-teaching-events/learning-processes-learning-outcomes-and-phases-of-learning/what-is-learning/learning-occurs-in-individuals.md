# Learning occurs in individuals

Learning is the ability to profit from experience and it is the
individual learner who profits from experience. In other words, it is
individuals who learn. The term *learning* refers to changes which are
occurring with respect to the skill, understandings, attitudes or
whatever of individual learners. In order to determine which of the
children in a class of children have learned to multiply we must observe
the multiplication skills of each individual child. When a teacher
administers a test to the children in her class, she records each
child\'s mark separately and it is this individual achievement which is
discussed with the child, reported to parents, and so on.

Any procedure which we use to study learning must, therefore, be a
procedure which is capable of tracking changes (over time) in the
competencies of individual learners. Single-case procedures meet this
requirement. Between-groups procedures do not meet this requirement
because it is impossible to generalise from the average performance of a
group of learners to the performance of any of the individual learners
in that group.
