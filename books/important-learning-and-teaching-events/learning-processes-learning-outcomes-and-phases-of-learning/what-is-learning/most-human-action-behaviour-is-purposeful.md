# Most human action (behaviour) is purposeful

Most behaviours are engaged in for some purpose. When a teacher gives an
instruction the teacher usually expects or intends that the instruction
will be followed. The same action may be engaged in on different
occasions for different purposes. On some occasions, a child may put her
hand up to indicate that she wants to answer the question, on other
occasions to indicate that she wants some help, on yet other occasions
to indicate that she wants to go to the toilet, and so on. Furthermore,
different actions may be engaged in for the same purpose. There are many
different actions which a child may use to attract the attention of the
teacher, for example.

In order to make sense of what people do and say and think, therefore,
we need to take into account not only what a person does, but also the
purpose which that action serves. To say that "Anton yelled" is not very
meaningful. To say that "Anton yelled to attract my attention", or that
"Anton yelled to warn me of the approaching bus" is more meaningful. The
same is true of learning to act and talk and think in new ways. The
actions which we learn and remember are the ones which turn out to be
the most successful ways of achieving particular purposes.

This observation suggests that, for the study of learning, the most
appropriate unit of analysis is not a particular type of action (defined
in terms of the action alone) but a unit which consists of both the
action-and-its-purpose. It follows, therefore, that any procedure which
we use to study learning must be one which is capable of tracking
changes in these action-and-purpose units over time.
