The actions of learners also have effects. These effects may be the same
as the purpose for which the action was performed or they may be
different. In other words, an action may be successful in achieving the
goal intended, or it may be unsuccessful. A teacher may give an
instruction with the intention that it be followed, but the instruction
may or may not be followed. A child may raise her hand with the
intention of attracting the teacher\'s attention, but this action may be
successful or unsuccessful. A child may attempt to solve a new kind of
problem (using the procedure described by the teacher) and may get the
answer correct, or not get it correct. It follows, therefore, that any
procedure which we use to study learning must be one which is capable of
tracking not only particular action-and-purpose units but also their
effects (that is, whether or not they are successful) each time they
occur.

Since the actions which we use on future occasions tend to be those
which have been most successful on past occasions, the ability to track
the consequences, effects and outcomes of particular actions over time
is a matter of critical importance in the scientific study of those
changes which we refer to as learning. Attempts to study the
relationships between teaching events and behaviour change, but which
fail to track each attempt to perform the new behaviour together with
the consequences or outcomes of each of these attempts, will almost
certainly fail to collect the very data which is needed in order to
explain the changes which are observed.
