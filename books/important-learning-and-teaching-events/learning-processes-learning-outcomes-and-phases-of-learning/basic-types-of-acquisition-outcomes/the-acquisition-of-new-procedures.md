Some acquisition outcomes involve learning to perform a new operation or
procedure. A procedure is a sequence of responses which must be
performed in a particular order if the sequence is to have the desired
outcome. Initially, the learner cannot perform the sequence of responses
in the correct order (although they may be able to perform individual
responses when prompted to do so). The aim is to bring the learner to
the point where they can perform the entire sequence in order, to a
satisfactory standard, without assistance.

This kind of change is referred to using a variety of terms. Sequence of
responses are variously referred to as "skills", "operations",
"strategies" "procedures", "chains", "chained tasks" and so on. We will
refer to a skill which involves the performance of a sequence of
responses or steps as a *procedure.*

Many of the skills listed in the curriculum are skills which take the
form of procedures. Many everyday skills such as showering, getting
dressed, getting one\'s breakfast, cooking a meal, washing the dishes,
fixing a puncture, and so on are procedures. Many mathematics operations
such as multidigit addition and subtraction, long multiplication and
division, multiplying fractions, calculating areas, simplifying
algebraic expressions, and so on, are procedures. Early spelling
involves this kind of learning - the pupil must learn to write the
letters of particular words in a particular order. And many advanced
academic skills consist of procedures. For example, finding a word in a
dictionary, finding a book in a library, solving physics problems,
making summary notes, rehearsing material to memorise it, and setting
out written work according to a given convention are all examples of
procedures.

Some writers argue that we should distinguish between procedures which
involve motor responses (such as getting dressed), those which involve
verbal responses (such as working a long multiplication problem), and
metacognitive procedures (such as self-rehearsal). However research
suggests that, where the aim is to teach the learner how to perform a
new sequence of responses, the teaching procedures which are required
are much the same regardless of whether the skill is a motor skill, a
verbal skill or a metacognitive skill (Marchand-Martella, Martella,
Christensen, Agran, & Young, 1992; Rivera & Smith, 1988; Skinner,
Beatty, Turco, & Rasavage, 1989).

**Measuring the acquisition of new procedures.** Where a new skill takes
the form of a procedure (a sequence of steps), the teacher may code the
student\'s performance at each step as either "satisfactory" (i.e.
performed to the required standard without assistance) or
"unsatisfactory" (i.e. not up to standard, or performed only with
assistance). To apply this measure, the teacher asks the learner to
perform as many of the steps as they are able. A delayed prompting
procedure is used to prompt those steps which the learner cannot yet
perform (or the teacher may complete the steps which the learner cannot
yet perform). Performance of the skill at any point in time can be
measured by counting the number of steps completed to a satisfactory
standard without assistance. Increases, from day to day in the number of
steps completed without assistance provide a measure of the rate of
improvement on this kind of acquisition outcome.
