# Acquiring an adequate receptive vocabulary

While an adequate level of reading fluency is necessary for
comprehension it is not sufficient for comprehension. Comprehension of a
text requires also that the student knows (has learned) the meanings of
most of the words in the text. Only if the student can instantly
recognise and instantly comprehend the meaning of most of the words
contained in a text will the learner comprehend the text as a whole. It
follows therefore that receptive vocabulary development also plays an
important role in learning to read increasingly advanced texts (Adams,
1990; Jenkins & O\'Connor, 2002).

At each level, learning to read proceeds much more rapidly if the
meanings of the words which are being read are already known to the
child. Where this is the case the child has only to acquire one
equivalence relation (rather than two) in order to recognise a word as a
meaningful word in its printed form (Sidman, 1994). This suggests that
receptive vocabulary size (the number of words which the learner knows
as meaningful words) plays an important role throughout the process of
learning to read.

Finally, the novice reader must acquire a knowledge of the conventions
governing the structure and organisation of the various written genres.
This means that, following the first three years at school, the student
should be exposed not only to narrative texts, but also to descriptive,
expository and explanatory texts on a regular basis.
