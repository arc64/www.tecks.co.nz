There have been many hundreds of research based analyses of how children
learn to read and the results of this research have been summarised by
many authors (e.g. Adams, 1990; Jenkins & O\'Connor, 2002; National
Reading Panel, 2000). These analyses suggest that:

-   in order to read with comprehension (at any level), the learner must
    have previously acquired (a) a knowledge of the meanings of most of
    the words in the text and (b) the ability to read that text at a
    functional level of fluency.
-   in order to read with a functional level of fluency, the learner
    must have previously acquired (a) the ability to instantly recognise
    a majority of the words in the text and (b) the ability to decode
    the remaining words with a functional level of decoding fluency.
-   in order to acquire an age appropriate sight word vocabulary
    (vocabulary of words which can be instantly recognised) and a
    functional level of decoding fluency, the learner must have mastered
    the most commonly occurring of the grapheme-phoneme equivalence
    relations which occur in written English.
-   in order to acquire grapheme-phoneme equivalence relations in a
    timely fashion the child must be able (a) to distinguish between
    each of the 52 printed letters and (b) distinguish between each of
    the 43 English language phonemes.

This process is pictured in the following diagram.

Each of these skills is distinguished because each involves a different
type of learning outcome and, hence, the provision of different types of
learning experiences if they are to be acquired in a timely fashion.
Each of these skills is described in greater detail in the sections
which follow.

A knowledge of the component skills which must be acquired during the
process of learning to read is essential knowledge for all teachers,
teacher educators, teaching researchers and anyone else who is involved
in teaching children to read. Without this knowledge the teacher of
reading will be unable to assess the learner's current level of reading
development, identify component skills weaknesses which are causing
delays in learning to read, describe research participants, plan a
reading programme, or provide the teaching conditions necessary to
ensure that each child masters each of the various component skills in a
timely fashion.
