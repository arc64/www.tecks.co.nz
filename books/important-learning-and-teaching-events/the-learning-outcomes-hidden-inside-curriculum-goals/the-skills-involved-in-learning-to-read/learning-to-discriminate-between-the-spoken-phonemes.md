In order to begin to learn the letter-sound equivalence relations which
will be necessary in order to make timely progress in learning to read,
the child must also learn to discriminate between the 43 phonemes of
which spoken English is comprised. Standard English uses 25 consonant
phonemes and the 18 vowel and diphthong phonemes. The ability to aurally
discriminate between the 43 English phonemes is variously referred to as
phoneme awareness, phonemic awareness, phonological awareness, and
linguistic awareness. The most appropriate term is phoneme
discrimination skill.

Teaching a child to distinguish between 43 different sounds is a
discrimination training exercise similar to the task of teaching a child
to discriminate, by ear, between 43 notes on a piano. Because many
phonemes can be articulated only as part of a word, phoneme
discrimination exercises always need to point to the position (in the
word) of the target phoneme. The most common kind of response used
during this kind of training is to ask the child whether two spoken
sounds (e.g. at the beginning of a word) are "the same or different".
Matching responses ("Which of these is the same?") may also be used.

"A lack of phonological sensitivity makes the learning of
grapheme-to-phoneme correspondences very difficult" (Stanovich, 1988, p.
601). Actually it probably makes it impossible. It hardly seems likely
that a child could learn to name 43 notes on the piano by ear if they
could not discriminate between some of the notes.
