Because mathematics is strongly hierarchical, it is not sufficient for
the child simply to learn how to respond correctly or when to use a
particular procedure. Growth in early arithmetic competence is strongly
correlated with the child\'s level of fluency in naming and writing
letters and numbers (Siders, Siders & Wilson, 1985) and in the fast
recognition of small quantities (Young-Loveridge, 1991). Practice with
the equivalence relationships and the core arithmetical procedures needs
to continue until correct responses have been memorised, that is, until
an adequate level of fluency (automaticity) has been achieved with
respect to each of the performances and understandings which will be
built upon at the next step in the mathematics curriculum.

In well developed teaching programmes in early mathematics the fluency
level which is used to define fluency is usually set somewhere between
70 and 80 correct written digits per minute (Binder, Haughton & Bateman,
2002; Johnson & Layng, 1992). One of the major shortcomings of most
mathematics curricula is that they fail to specify the fluency criteria
which are to be met by children at each age level with respect to such
things as number recognition, single digit maths facts and essential
operations. Without this information it is impossible for the classroom
teacher to determine whether or not children are receiving sufficient
fluency building practice to ensure future success in mathematics, and
it is impossible for researchers either to select or to describe the
participants taking part in research into the learning and/or teaching
of mathematics.
