# Learning mathematical operations

In addition to mathematical concepts, maths curricula also contain
numerous calculation procedures. These calculation procedures are most
commonly referred to as operations. They are also referred to as
"algorithms", "strategies", and "processes". For consistency we will
refer to these operations as procedures.

Mathematical operations are rule guided procedures (Church, 1999). They
consist of a number of steps which are performed on two or more concepts
such as numerical quantities. The steps can be identified by performing
a task analysis which identifies each of the component operations which
must be undertaken in order to arrive at the correct result.

A task analysis of any particular mathematical procedure produces a
hierarchy of learning objectives "such that mastery of objectives lower
in the hierarchy (simpler tasks) facilitates learning of higher
objectives (more complex tasks), and ability to perform higher-level
tasks reliably predicts ability to perform lower level tasks" (Resnick
et al., 1973, p. 679). A detailed analysis of many of the learning
hierarchies which are involved in elementary arithmetic will be found in
Silbert et al. (1990).

An example of a simple hierarchy of learning objectives, the component
steps which must be mastered in order to solve a two-digit addition
problem, are shown in Figure 2333.

The hierarchical nature of mathematics curricula has extremely important
implications for teaching practice for it means that progress through
the curriculum will be dependent upon mastery, by the child, of each of
the terms, concepts and procedures from earlier in the curriculum
(Underhill et al., 1980). In order to learn how to perform a new
mathematical procedure the child must be able to (a) associate a symbol
(e.g. =, +, x) with that operation, (b) remember the sequence of steps
involved in the operation and (c) be able to automatically recall the
equivalence relations which are embedded in problems of this type (Smith
& Rivera, 1991).
