# Learning mathematical equivalence relations

The first step in coming to understand a mathematical concept such as
the quantity "eight" is mastery of a set of six equivalence relations
between the name of the concept, its mathematical symbol, and examples
or representations which contain the defining features of the concept.
These equivalence relations have also been referred to as simple facts
(Engelmann & Carnine, 1991), "interactive units" (Cawley & Reines,
1996), "central conceptual structures" (Griffin & Case, 1997) and so on.
The six basic equivalence relations for the concept of "eight", for
example are shown in the following figure

of "eight" (Adapted from Sidman,

"eight" (Adapted from Sidman, 1994).*

As can be seen from Figure 2331, the six basic equivalence relations for
a concept like the quantity "eight" consist of three pairs of reversible
stimulus-response relations. Research (e.g. Sidman, 1994) has shown that
once one member of the pair has been learned, the stimulus and response
elements are usually found to be interchangeable. The technical name for
this interchangeability is *reversibility.* The reversibility property
means that, although there are six equivalence relationships to be
learned, only three of these actually need to be taught and practised
(Sidman, 1994). This greatly simplifies the task facing the learner (and
the task facing the teacher as well). In fact, if any two pairs of
equivalence relations have been acquired, the child will almost
certainly be able to perform the responses in the third pair of
relations without additional instruction (Sidman, 1994). This further
simplifies the task of learning (and teaching) mathematical concepts at
each age level -- at least for teachers who have a clear understanding
of the nature of equivalence relations in mathematics.
