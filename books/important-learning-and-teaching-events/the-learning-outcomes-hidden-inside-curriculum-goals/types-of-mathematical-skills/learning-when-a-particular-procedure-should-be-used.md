Knowing how to perform a particular mathematical procedure is of little
practical value unless the learner also acquires the ability to
recognise those situations in which this procedure can, and cannot, be
used to solve a mathematical or measurement problem. "Knowing when to
use a procedure is just as indispensable for successful cognitive
activity as knowing how to execute the procedure or understanding the
concepts that underlie it" (Siegler, 1991, p. 128).

The situation facing the learner here is closely similar to the
situation facing the learner who is learning the meaning of, and how to
use, a new maths concept such as the concept of "eight". Understanding,
that is, generalisation of the use of the procedure, occurs as a result
of experiences of two types: opportunities to apply the procedure to the
full range of problems to which it can be applied and, secondly,
opportunities to distinguish between those problems to which the
procedure can be applied and those to which it cannot be applied. It is
probably this fact which has led a number of writers to conclude that
procedural knowledge and conceptual knowledge develop in an interactive
or reciprocal fashion -- with each influencing the other (Gersten &
Chard, 1999; Siegler, 1991).
