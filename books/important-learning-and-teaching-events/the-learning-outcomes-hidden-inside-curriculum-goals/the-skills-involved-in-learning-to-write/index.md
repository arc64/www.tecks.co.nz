# The skills involved in learning to write

Although there has been less research into the development of writing
skills than there has been into the development of reading skills, the
research into how children learn to write is nevertheless substantial
(e.g. Baker, Gersten & Graham, 2003; Berninger & Amtmann, 2003; Gersten
& Baker, 2001; Moats, 1995; Templeton & Morris, 2000).

Structural analyses of the process of learning to write suggest that the
early development of compositional writing skills depends upon the
acquisition of fluent performance of a number of component skills. The
developmental sequence for these component skills is pictured in Figure
2320.

1.In order to become a competent writer, the learner must (a) acquire a
knowledge of writing conventions (e.g. grammatical rules, punctuation
rules, etc.), (b) learn how to plan and revise written work, (c) acquire
a large automatised spelling vocabulary, and (d) acquire a high level of
fluency in handwriting and/or typing skills.

2.There are at least three component skills in learning to spell in
English. The first is mastery of the phoneme--\>grapheme equivalence
relations necessary in order to learn the spellings of regularly spelled
syllables and words. The second is mastery of the spelling of all of the
commonly used words with irregular spellings (Dixon & Engelmann, 1999)
and the third is the acquisition of morphographic knowledge, that is a
knowledge of the spelling of commonly occurring morphographs and rules
for combining morphographs. Because some of the grapheme-phoneme
equivalence relations are reversible, some of this knowledge is acquired
during learning to read. However, much of it -- especially the
morphological knowledge and the phoneme-grapheme relationships which are
unique to spelling -- requires explicit teaching if it is to be acquired
in a timely fashion.

3\. Before a child can learn the phoneme-grapheme equivalence relations
they must first be able to discriminate between each of the graphemes
and each of the phonemes.

The reason why each of these skills needs to be distinguished is not
because they involve different kinds of actions but because the mastery
of each depends upon the provision of different types of learning
experiences. Each of these skills is described in greater detail in the
sections which follow.

A knowledge of the component skills which must be acquired during the
process of learning to write is essential knowledge not only for
teachers, but also for teaching researchers. Without this knowledge, the
teacher of writing will be unable to assess the learner's current level
of development in writing, identify component skills weaknesses which
are causing delays in learning to write, plan a teaching programme, or
provide the teaching conditions necessary to ensure that each child
acquires each of the various component skills in a timely fashion.
