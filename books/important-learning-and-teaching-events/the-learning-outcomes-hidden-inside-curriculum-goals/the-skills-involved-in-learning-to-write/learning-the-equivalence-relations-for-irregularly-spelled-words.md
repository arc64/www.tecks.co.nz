While the spelling of approximately 50% of words can be predicted from a
knowledge of phoneme--\>grapheme equivalences, the other half cannot, at
least not in their entirety. In fact about 60 per cent of the 500 words
used most often in writing have partly irregular spellings (Moats,
1995). There are a number of reasons for this.

-   In some words the same phoneme can be represented by more than one
    spelling pattern. For example, the long \|e\| sound can be
    represented by "ee", "ea", "ei", "y", and several other spellings.
-   In some words the spelling of a phoneme is given by the pattern or
    position of letters in a word. An example of this is the case where
    both a vowel and a final "e" is used to translate a long vowel
    sound. Compare, for example, "tap" and "tape".
-   In some words spelling depends upon orthographic conventions, such
    as knowing when to use "oy" or "oi" and when to use "dge" or "ge".
-   In some words the spelling is simply unique (e.g. "people",
    "straight", "friend" and "yacht").

These features of written English mean that the spelling of significant
numbers of words can be acquired only by means of systematic spelling
practice of those words which the child cannot yet spell correctly.
