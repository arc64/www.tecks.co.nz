# Learning the main grammatical concepts and rules

Grammar refers to a collection of skills which includes both a set of
concepts and a set of rule guided procedures. The concepts include such
stimulus classes as sentences, questions, singular and plural, parts of
speech (e.g. nouns and verbs), tense, possessives, direct speech, and so
on. The rules describe the conventions relating to the formation of
sentences, agreement with respect to tense, the formation of plurals,
and the punctuation of sentences, direct speech, questions, and so on.
The main New Zealand curriculum reference for grammatical and
punctuation conventions is *Exploring language: A handbook for teachers*
(Ministry of Education, 1996).

While much has been written about the grammatical structure of English,
there has been little research into the way in which children develop an
understanding and ability to use these grammatical concepts and
conventions and, hence, little is known about how this learning should
be sequenced.
