Initially, the act of transcribing thoughts consumes so much working
memory that there is little left over for planning or revising. One of
the implications of this is that early instruction in writing should
emphasise the development of fluency in writing and spelling so that the
learner can progress to thoughtful compositional writing as soon as
possible (Berninger, 1999). By age 9 or 10 the resource demands imposed
by transcription (handwriting and spelling) decrease to a manageable
level for most children, and no longer interfere with children\'s text
generation (McCutchen, 1996).

Detailed accounts of the processes which are presumed to be involved in
mature compositional writing have been provided by a number of authors
(Gersten & Baker, 2001; Hayes & Flower, 1980; Kameenui, Carnine, Dixon,
Simmons & Coyne, 2002; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1986). These accounts
suggest that skilled writing is a recursive activity involving four
interacting procedures: planning, composing (or text generation),
editing, and revising. However, there is little agreement amongst
writing researchers as to how these learning outcomes should be defined
or measured and there has been little research into the developmental
progression which occurs with respect to each of these components of
writing competence.
