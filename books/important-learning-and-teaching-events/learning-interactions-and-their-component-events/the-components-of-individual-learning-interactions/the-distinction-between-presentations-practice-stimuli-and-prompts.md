# The distinction between presentations, practice stimuli and prompts

Teachers use many different kinds of antecedent instructional events.
Three of these serve such different instructional functional that they
must always be distinguished. These are presentations, practice stimuli,
and prompts.

In teaching situations, one of the most commonly observed kinds of
antecedent stimulus events is the presentation of curriculum relevant
information by the teacher. In this account, messages which the learner
receives from the verbal environment will be referred to as
*presentations*.

Parents and teachers also provide practice opportunities by providing
questions, exercises, problems and other kinds of stimuli for the
learner to respond to. We will call these kinds of antecedent events
*practice stimuli.*

A third kind of antecedent event is the stimulus which serves the
function of showing the learner how to perform a new behaviour (or how
to respond correctly to a new stimulus). We will refer to these kinds of
antecedents as *prompts.*

The following exchange illustrates the difference between a
presentation, a practice stimulus and a prompt.

and a presentation*

In this interaction the teacher points to the word car. The question
indicates that the learner is expected to read the word. This makes the
printed word car a practice stimulus. The learner\'s response indicates
that she cannot yet respond correctly to this stimulus. The teacher then
says "You came to school in one of these today." Since the child now
gives the correct response, it is clear that this antecedent has
functioned as a prompt. Next the teacher makes a statement about "how
people travel to school". No response is expected, so this statement is
not a practice stimulus. The statement does not describe how to respond
correctly, so it is not a prompt. But the statement does contain
information and this makes it a presentation.
