# The mode of the prompt

There are two general types of prompts: stimulus prompts and behaviour
prompts and these two types of prompts are distinguished because they
serve different functions. Each of these types of prompts may be
delivered in a number of different modes. An awareness of the different
kinds of prompting procedures is very useful for a teacher because, if a
particular type of prompt does not work, the teacher may proceed to
select a more effective prompting procedure.
