# Presentation meaningfulness

Presentations may be more or less meaningful to the individual learner.
A meaningful presentation is one which "makes sense" to the learner. In
some accounts, meaningful presentations are referred to as
comprehensible presentations. In everyday language we talk about
presentations which the learner "understands" or "comprehends". In spite
of the importance of the meaningfulness dimension, meaningfulness
remains an extremely slippery concept, one which has yet to be
adequately defined, and one which remains difficult to measure.

The meaningfulness dimension of instructional presentations is of
critical importance because the content of meaningful presentations is
more likely to be remembered than the content of presentations which are
not meaningful to the learner .
