# Overt vs. covert responses

*An overt response is one which can be seen or heard by others.* Some
writers refer to these as public responses. *A covert response is one
which cannot be seen by other people.* Covert responding is variously
referred to as cognitive processing, thinking, reflecting, "working it
out in the head", and so on. Covert responding includes such activities
as silent reading, thinking about the material which is being read,
constructing an answer to a problem in one's mind, self-rehearsal of
selected facts, and so on.

The distinction between overt and covert responding is extremely
important because, when a teacher addresses a question to an entire
class or group of students the teacher often assumes that all of the
students are mentally constructing an answer to the question and
research has shown that this assumption is seldom correct.
