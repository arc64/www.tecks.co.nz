Many different kinds of practice responses are possible; overt responses
and covert responses, constructed responses and selection responses,
verbal responses and performance responses, oral responses and written
responses. These distinctions are quite important because different
types of learning outcomes involve different types of response modes and
these different types of learning outcomes are more likely to be
achieved if the response mode required by the learning activity matches
the response mode involved in the learning outcome.
