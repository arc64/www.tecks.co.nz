Sometimes students are set to work on activities where they have to
select the correct spelling from several options, or select the correct
name from the names given, or select the correct answer from examples
given. *A selection response is one where the learner selects a given
option from a limited number of possibilities by pointing, circling,
ticking, underlining or clicking on the option which has been selected*.

Other learning activities require the student to create, construct or
complete a response or action or procedure. For example, the student
might be asked to write (construct) a one paragraph description, or to
generate an answer to a teacher question, or to complete the incomplete
answer of another student.

The distinction between constructed responses and selection responses is
an important one because the two types of responding have different
effects both on acquisition and on remembering.
