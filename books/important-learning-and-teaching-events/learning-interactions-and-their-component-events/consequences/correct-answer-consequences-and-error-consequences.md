# Correct answer consequences and error consequences

Consequences may also be classified according to the type of response
which they follow. For example, reinforcing consequences may follow
improvements, they may follow correct responses, they may follow correct
and speedy responses, and so on. They may also follow errors and they
may follow inappropriate behaviour (although this is more likely to be
accidental than intentional.) In this account, the consequences which
follow correct responses will be referred to as *right answer
consequences* and the consequences which follow incorrect responses will
be referred to as *error consequences*.

Being absolutely clear about the difference between correct and
incorrect responses in the skills and understandings which are being
taught is an essential teaching competence because it is a prerequisite
to ensuring that reinforcing consequences only ever follow correct
behaviour and not misbehaviour, and that corrections and other possibly
punishing consequences only ever follow incorrect and/or inappropriate
responses.
