# Learned punishers

Punishing consequences are consequences which the individual tries to
avoid and the learned punishers are those consequences which function as
punishers by virtue of the society or culture in which one lives and by
virtue of the training which that culture provides during the
socialisation of its young. The learned punishers include those events
which have acquired the power to make us feel foolish, embarrassed,
intimidated, anxious, or fearful. For most individuals this includes
such events as the negative reactions of others, insults, jokes at our
expense, the unwanted demands of others, criticism, reprimands, negative
feedback, being treated like a younger person, and so on.

Learned punishers are culturally relative. A particular phrase which
functions as an insult or a reprimand in one society or culture may have
no meaning and hence no aversive affect in another culture. Whether or
not a particular event (such as a warning) will function as a learned
punisher also depends upon the age and learning history of the
individual child.

Because almost any event which regularly occurs in association with a
biological punisher (or previously acquired learned punisher) can
acquire punishing properties, the number of different kinds of events
which acquire punishing properties during the development of individual
children is huge. We may group these events into three general
categories: loss of access to preferred activities, the negative
reactions of others and negative feedback.

**Loss of access to desired activities**

Just as access to a desired activity will function as a reinforcing
consequence, so failure to gain access, or loss of access to a desired
activity will function as an aversive consequence. Let us say for
example, that a particular student completes more work when work
completion allows that child to work with her friend. This observation
suggests that working with the friend is reinforcing for this student.
If this is the case, then losing the right to work with the friend will
probably also function as an aversive consequence for this student. The
same will be true of any operation in which the child is deprived of
access to any activity which they have previously chosen to engage in.

**Negative reactions from others**

A negative reaction from another person is experienced as aversive by
the great majority of children and adults and the distinction between
approving and disapproving reactions is learned by most children at a
young age. Some of the kinds of social reactions which come to function
as punishers (aversive consequences) for most (but not all) children are
as follows*.*

-   *Being ignored.*
-   *Interruptions to the interaction*. For example, being asked to
    repeat an answer, being asked to explain an answer, having one\'s
    turn transferred to another student for a better answer
-   *Disagreement*. For example, "No, I disagree with that", "Who agrees
    with that?", "No, I wouldn\'t do that"
-   *Expressions of disappointment*. For example, "You can do better
    than this"
-   *Non-verbal expressions of disapproval*. For example, head shaking,
    scowl
-   *Verbal expressions of disapproval* *(reprimands).* For example,
    "Stop doing that", "Please don\'t do that", " I don\'t like that",
    "We don\'t do that here", "You did better than this yesterday",
    "This is not good enough"
-   *Loud or aggressive responses*. For example, being yelled at
-   *Threats.* For example, being told that unless your answers are
    correct, you will have to do the work over again.
-   *Reinforcer loss*. For example, having previously earned points
    taken away

**Negative feedback**

Not all responses are successful. Some are failures. In other words,
responses can produce negative feedback as well as positive feedback.
The feedback which follows incorrect responses is most commonly referred
to as "error feedback" or as "negative feedback". Feedback which tells
the learner that a behaviour is unsatisfactory in some way tends to have
a suppressive effect on that behaviour. For example, many children will
work hard not to make mistakes in their school work so that can avoid
the teacher corrections which result if the child makes a mistake. For
such children, we can see that error corrections have become aversive
consequences (because we can see the child trying hard to avoid them).
