In this section we identify some of the main events which learning
depends upon. These events have been the subject of scientific study for
the better part of 100 years and, as a result it is possible to describe
them with some confidence. The main problem which still faces learning
researchers is the problem of deciding upon the level of
specificity/generality which should be used when describing and
analysing different kinds of learning.

Activities which result in learning may be described at various levels
of abstraction. For example, a common level of analysis is the teaching
topic or unit of work. A teaching topic typically consists of several
lessons or class meetings each of which involves a number of
identifiable learning activities. This is the level of analysis which is
commonly employed for programme evaluations and method comparisons -- as
when an investigator compares a radical new method of teaching something
against the boring old "traditional method" of teaching the same thing.

At a less general and more specific level is an analysis at the level of
a particular learning activity. For example we might analyse or measure
the effects on learning of a single class lesson, or a single peer
tutoring session or a single instance of a fluency building game.

At the least general and most specific level we can analyse the effects
of single learning interactions. For example, we can describe the events
which go to make up a single learning interaction (such as responding to
a request to spell a particular word and receiving feedback on that
attempt) and we can measure the effects on learning of different forms
of learning interactions (such as learning interaction which include
feedback and those which do not include feedback following the practice
response).

We know from experience (and more than 100 years of research) that
learning can occur as a result of just one or two repetitions of an
experience so it is clear that the description and analysis of learning
must be at the level of individual learning interactions. We also know
that learning can result from interactions which are as small as
hearing, or saying, or seeing, or writing a single word so it is clear
that the description and analysis of individual learning interactions
must be at the level of specific responses that is, at the level of
specific and distinguishable behaviour-and-purpose units.

The ability to analyse learning activities at the level of the learning
interaction is a very important teaching and research skill because it
enables teachers and learning researchers to describe both the
particular types of learning interactions which have been selected for
use and, even more importantly, to describe the number of learning
opportunities received by each child.

In Section 1 of this chapter we define a learning interaction and its
component elements (antecedents, practice responses, and consequences).
Subsequent sections describe and define several types of antecedent
presentations (Sections 2) and antecedent prompts (Section 3). Section 4
describes various ways in which practice responses can vary and Section
5 describes several different kinds of consequences (such as
reinforcing, aversive and neutral consequences).
