Students spend much of their school day responding to instructional
questions, exercises, problems, and activities of various kinds and yet
the English language has no word to refer to these things. In this
account we will used the invented term *practice stimulus* to refer to
any kind of stimulus, question, exercise, or problem which the learner
is expected to respond to and we will refer to the responses which
result as *practice responses. A practice stimulus is an antecedent
stimulus event to which a response is expected*. Practice stimuli are
antecedent stimulus events which provide practice opportunities. They
may also result in practice responses. Note, however, that it is
possible for the teacher to present a practice stimulus (such as a
question) and hence to provide a practice opportunity (the opportunity
to construct an answer) but for no practice response to occur (perhaps
because the learner does not yet know the answer to the question which
has been asked.) Technically speaking, a practice stimulus which does
not result in any kind of response should be referred to as a "potential
practice stimulus".

Practice stimuli are of critical importance for learning. Without
practice stimuli there can be no practice responses. And without
practice responses (either overt or covert) there will usually be no
learning.

Practice stimuli can take many different forms. They can take the form
of objects to be named, symbols (e.g. words) to be read, questions to be
answered, exercises to be worked, problems to be solved, activities to
be completed, and so on. They may occur in various modes, and they may
be teacher initiated or child initiated.
