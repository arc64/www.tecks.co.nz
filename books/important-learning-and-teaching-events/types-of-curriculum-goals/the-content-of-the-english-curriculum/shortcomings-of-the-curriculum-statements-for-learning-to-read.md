The problem posed by the very broad and general achievement objectives
for reading is not overcome by the listing of "developmental indicators"
in *Effective literacy practice* (Ministry of Education, 2003) because
(a) developmental indicators are only listed for Years 1 and 4 and (b)
the Year 4 indicators are too poorly specified to be used as criteria
for measuring progress in learning to read. In fact, the curriculum
materials for the teaching of reading provide no information regarding
achievement objectives for any of the component skills which must be
mastered en route to becoming a competent reader. They contain no
information on the rate of progress which is to be expected with respect
to learning to discriminate between each of the 52 letters, learning to
discriminate between each of the 43 English language phonemes, learning
of the common grapheme-phoneme equivalence relations, the development of
decoding fluency, the development of word reading fluency for high
frequency words, the development of prose reading fluency, or the
development of comprehension monitoring skills.

If New Zealand is to continue in its attempts to establish \"national
standards\" in learning to read, the Ministry will need to develop
operational definitions of each of the component skills which are
involved in learning to read, will need to develop standardised measures
of fluency in each of these component skills and will need to engage in
the kind of epidemiological research which can provide reliable data
concerning the fluency levels which are currently being achieved in each
of these component skills by New Zealand children at each Year level.
This kind of research has been undertaken overseas and has been shown to
provide information which is extremely useful to classroom teachers (see
for example, Hasbrouck & Tindal, 1992). In their 1992 survey, Hasbrouck
and Tindal found that the median fluency level on age appropriate
narrative texts was 115 correct words per minute after 3 years at
school, 120 correct words per minute after 4 years at school and 130
correct words per minute after 5 years at school.
