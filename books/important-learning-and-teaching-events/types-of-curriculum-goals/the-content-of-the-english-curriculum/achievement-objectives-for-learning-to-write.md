Teachers have access to several supplementary publications which support
the teaching of expressive writing. The first of these *Exploring
language: A handbook for teachers* (Ministry of Education, 1996)
contains extensive descriptions of the elements of English grammar
(including parts of speech, language rules, types of meaning, phrases
and sentences, direct and indirect speech), phonemic analysis (including
consonants, vowels, diphthongs, Maori phonemes, intonation, and
prosody), the rules of conversation, genre (types of texts), and
semiotics (non-verbal signs and symbols). The main purpose of the
*Handbook* is to provide teachers with basic information about oral,
written and visual language. In this respect the *Handbook* elaborates
the content implied in some of the upper level English achievement
objectives. However, the *Handbook* does not spell out language learning
objectives in any greater detail than that contained in the English
curriculum statement.

The second, *Effective literacy practice* (Ministry of Education, 2003)
is a handbook for teachers on how to teach reading and writing to
children in years 1 to 4. It includes a very short account of the
writing process, a one paragraph account of how to access *The New
Zealand Curriculum Exemplars* to assess writing quality*,* a list of
progress indicators and some suggestions for writing activities. Under
the heading "Approaches to writing" are descriptions of language
experience activities, shared writing, interactive writing, guided
writing and independent writing. Under the heading "Creating texts" are
short descriptions of how to prompt and support topic selection,
composition, revision, presentation and publication.

*Effective literacy practice* includes, a list of "developmental
indicators" for writing during the first four years of schooling which
are more explicit than those provide in the New Zealand curriculum. Some
of these "developmental indicators\": are listed in the following table.
