# Shortcomings of the writing curriculum

The achievement objectives listed in the New Zealand curriculum for
writing are even less explicit than those for reading. These achievement
objectives are largely useless as a guide to instructional planning or
progress monitoring since that provide no indication of the level of
achievement of each of the component skills which need to be mastered
during the process of learning to write. This problem is not solved by
the inclusion of "developmental indicators" in *Effective literacy
practice* (Ministry of Education, 2003) because developmental indicators
are given only for two levels (year 1 and year 4), there is no reference
to any kind of performance criterion for any of the year 4 "indicators".

A careful search of Ministry of Education curriculum documents on the
teaching of writing finds no information on the level of performance
which children are expected to achieve with respect to any of the
components skills which must be acquired during the process of becoming
a competent writer. They contain no information on the rate of progress
which is to be expected with respect to the development of
printing/writing/keyboarding fluency, the development of phonemic
awareness, learning of the main phoneme-grapheme equivalence relations,
the development of morphographic knowledge, mastery of the spellings of
high frequency words, rate of development of spelling skills, the
acquisition of punctuation and grammatical skills, the development of
writing fluency, or the acquisition of planning, reviewing, and revising
skills. Clearly this is a deficiency in the curriculum documents which
needs to be remedied before teachers are asked to increase literacy
levels.

The develop of measurable achievement objectives and achievement
standards in primary school writing is not an impossibly difficult task
and could be accomplished relatively quickly. An example of what is
possible is provided by Graham, Berninger, Weintraub and Shafer (1998)
who asked samples of children from US grades 1 through 9 to copy an age
appropriate paragraph as quickly as possible without making any
mistakes. They found the following mean handwriting speeds at each grade
level: grade 1: 19, grade 2: 34, grade 3: 48, grade 4: 64, grade 5: 73,
grade 6: 84, grade 7: 100 and grade 8: 115 letters per minute. At all
levels, the average girl wrote at least 4 letters a minute faster than
the average boy. Van Galen (1990, cited in Graham & Weintraub, 1996)
reports that skilled writers can produce cursive script at a rate of six
strokes per second for short periods of time. If a functional level of
writing speed is defined as 80 legible letters per minute, it appears
that the average child in these US samples achieves a functional level
of handwriting fluency around about 11 years of age, that is, after
about six years at school.
