# Levels of specificity in curriculum statements

Achievement objectives can be described with varying levels of
specificity. For example, a curriculum goal for the end of Year 2 in,
say, learning to read might be given at any of the following levels of
specificity (ordered from least to most specific):

-   "shows continuing improvement in reading"
-   "reads a range of texts with increasing enjoyment and comprehension"
-   "reads a range of texts at the 6.5 year level with enjoyment and
    comprehension"
-   "reads a range of texts at the 6.5 year level at 90 correct words
    per minute and with at least 80% comprehension".
-   "reads both narrative texts (stories) and descriptive texts at the
    6.5 year level at 90 correct words per minute and with at least 80%
    comprehension".

Generally speaking, teachers prefer curriculum goals which are couched
in fairly general terms because this gives the teacher considerable
freedom in determining the kinds of learning activities which he or she
can employ, the learning goals which can be pursued during these
activities, the assessment tasks which can be used at the end of the
activity, and the standard of student performance which defines a
"successful" classroom learning activity.

Parents on the other hand want to know whether their child is making
adequate progress in learning to read, learning to spell and write,
learning to relate to other children, and so on. This is only possible
if the school curriculum specifies achievement standards with a level of
specificity sufficient to allow such judgements to be made.
