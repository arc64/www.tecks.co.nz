Although achievement objectives are given with a greater degree of
specificity in the mathematics curriculum than they are in any of the
other seven curriculum statements, most are still expressed in terms
which are too general to be used as the basis for programme design,
lesson planning, or outcomes assessment.

A second shortcoming of the mathematics curriculum is an almost complete
failure to specify whether a given achievement objective is to be taught
as a name, as an equivalence relation, as a concept, as a general
principle, as an operation, or as a general understanding. Given that
different types of assessment are required in order to measure progress
towards each of these different kinds of learning outcomes, it is now no
longer appropriate for curriculum documents to be written by educators
who lack even this very basic knowledge of the elements of instructional
design.

Thirdly and most importantly, the curriculum contains no performance
standards. The addition and subtraction facts with sums to 20 are set
down as one of the achievement objectives for years 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 but
there is no indication as to when mastery of these "number facts" is to
be achieved and there is no indication of the level of fluency which
students are to acquire before they move on to operations with larger
numbers.

Because mathematics learning is sequential and cumulative, early
concepts, facts and operations be need to be practised until they have
been memorised and can be immediately recalled. Failure to achieve this
level of fluency with early operations very greatly reduces the
likelihood that later operations will be mastered. This is why it is
essential that the mathematics curriculum specify the level of fluency
which is to be achieved with respect to all operations and especially
with respect to the early number operations such as ordering, sorting,
sharing, the single digit operations, operations with simple fractions,
and so on.

It is this failure to provide recommended assessment tasks and benchmark
fluency standards which almost certainly explains the weaknesses in
student performance which are being identified by the National Education
Monitoring Project reports of student performance in mathematics. The
2005 report, for example found that there had been a marked decline in
recall of basic number facts and in solving simple number problems
particularly at year 4, that less than half of year 8 students could
find the sum of 1⁄2 + 1⁄4, that many students were unable to calculate
simple percentage discounts on prices (e.g. 10% off \$4.50) and that
only about half of year 8 students knew how to answer division tasks
involving remainders, such as 14 ÷ 3 (Flockton, Crooks, Smith & Smith,
2006). This lack of proficiency did not go unnoticed by the national
press (Andrew & Claridge, 2006).

As with the curriculum statements for learning to read and learning to
write, the mathematics curriculum needs to be developed in a way which
provides teachers with greater guidance regarding the annual performance
benchmarks which are to be used as measures of student progress in
mathematics.
