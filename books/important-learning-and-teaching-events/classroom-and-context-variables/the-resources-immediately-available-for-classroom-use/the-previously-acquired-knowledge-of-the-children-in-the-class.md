It is important to recognise that, in a classroom of 25-30 students,
students are likely to be learning as much from each other as they are
learning from the teacher. This is because, in the context of the modern
Western classroom, the students have more contact with each other than
they do with the teacher. This means that the collective knowledge of
the students in a classroom is a variable which is likely to be having a
major impact on what is, and is not, being learned in that setting. The
effects of this variable have been the subject of very little research.
In fact, the variable does not even have an agreed name. So it is hardly
surprising to find that procedures for measuring variations in the
collective knowledge of the students in a class of students have yet to
be devised.
