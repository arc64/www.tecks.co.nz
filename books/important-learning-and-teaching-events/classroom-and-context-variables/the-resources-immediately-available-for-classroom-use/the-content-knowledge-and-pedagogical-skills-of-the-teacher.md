# The content knowledge and pedagogical skills of the teacher

It is widely assumed that the rate of progress made by students in the
classroom setting is strongly determined by the content knowledge and
pedagogical knowledge of the teacher (e.g. Darling-Hammond, 2000; Rivers
& Sanders, 2002). It is strange, therefore, to discover that little
progress has been made in identifying the particular kinds of content
knowledge and the particular kinds of teaching skills which need to be
measured during studies of the effects of teacher knowledge on student
learning. In the majority of studies of the effects of teacher knowledge
on student learning, the teachers in the sample have been classified or
ranked using relatively crude measures such as length of the teacher
preparation course, whether the teacher has a bachelors level or masters
level qualification, or whether the teacher has completed a university
level qualification in their teaching subject (e.g. English, maths, or
whatever).

What is urgently needed are more sensitive measures of the various
dimensions of teacher competence so that we can begin to measure the
size of the effect of different pedagogical skills on student learning
and hence begin to identify the content knowledge and the pedagogical
skills which have the strongest effects on learning in the classroom.
