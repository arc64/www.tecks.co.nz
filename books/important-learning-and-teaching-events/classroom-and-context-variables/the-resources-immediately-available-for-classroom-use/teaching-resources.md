Effective concurrent teaching of 25 to 30 students simultaneously is
only possible if reasonable supplies of teaching, practice, and fluency
building materials are immediately available for classroom use at each
year level. This is because it simply is not physically possible to
create the materials required for 25 hours of teaching and marking for
25-30 students in a 40 hour working week.

The term *teaching materials* refers to the curriculum relevant
materials which are immediately accessible to all students in the
classroom or instructional group. Included under the heading of teaching
materials are the teaching programmes, text books, printed resources,
electronic resources, instruction sheets, exercise sheets, activity
sheets, problem solving sheets, educational games, practice activities,
and so on which are available for students to use. It is important to
note that the term "teaching materials" also includes practice
materials. That is, it includes all of the materials which are being
used to provide practice in newly acquired skills and to build
functional levels of fluency in newly acquired skills and
understandings.

Teaching resources may be divided into two general categories: (a) those
that have been rigorously field tested and which are known to be
effective for a defined group of students and (b) those which appear to
have face validity but which have never been field tested and which are,
therefore, of unknown effectiveness. In an ideal world the teaching
materials available to classroom teachers would be teaching programmes
and teaching materials of known effectiveness. At the present time,
however, such resources are relatively rare. So it is important that
stock-takes of the teaching resources which are available to each of the
teachers in a school distinguish carefully between materials of known
effectiveness and materials of unknown effectiveness.

The extent to which the classroom teaching is supported by adequate
levels of teaching resources may be measured by examining the resources
which are immediately available to every student in the classroom for
each of the curriculum topics in each of the curriculum areas which the
teacher intends to cover during the course of the school year.
