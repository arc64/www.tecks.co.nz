# The resources immediately available for classroom use

The effective teaching of 25 to 30 students concurrently for 5 hours a
day, 5 days a week is a task which becomes possible only if the school
provides sufficient diagnostic, assessment, teaching and practice
materials. Without adequate diagnostic materials, the teacher will be
unable to accurately identify appropriate teaching goals for individual
students. Without adequate teaching materials, the classroom teacher is
left having to "ad lib" whole class lesson activities for much of the
time which means that teaching is less effective than it could be.
Without adequate practice materials for students to use, the level of
practice engaged in by many students will be insufficient to ensure that
important skills and understandings are mastered and remembered.

There are four major kinds of material resources which are essential for
effective classroom practice. These are diagnostic assessment tests,
tests for monitoring progress, teaching materials of known
effectiveness, and practice materials. Other resources which affect
learning in the context of the classroom include the collective
knowledge of the other students in the class, the extent to which the
class is functioning as a "learning community", and the content
knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge of the teacher.
