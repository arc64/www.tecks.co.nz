When learning and teaching are occurring in schools, learning depends
not only on the variables referred to in earlier sections of this
chapter but also on a number of additional variables related to the fact
that teaching is occurring in the group setting of the classroom. When
teaching has to be carried out with groups of 25 to 30 learners
simultaneously the effects of that teaching depend upon many additional
factors: the teacher's ability to translate vaguely stated curriculum
objectives into specific lesson objectives, variability with respect to
what the learners have learned already, variability in children's
ability to tutor each other, the teaching resources which are available
to the teacher, the extent to which these resources enable the teacher
to meet the learning needs of individual children, and so on.

This chapter identifies the most important of the contextual variables
which operate to facilitate or hinder learning in the context of the
classroom. The discussion is organised under the following section
headings:

-   Section 1: school-wide and class-wide factors
-   Section 2: the diagnostic and teaching resources immediately
    available to the teacher (including teacher knowledge and the prior
    knowledge of the students)
-   Section 3: the extent to which instructional activities can be
    individualised to meet the needs of students with different learning
    histories
-   Section 4: the extent to which the context allows learning
    opportunities which are sufficient for each individual learner to
    achieve desired learning outcomes
-   Section 5: the extent to which the teacher is able to monitor the
    progress of individual students from day to day and
-   Section 6: the extent to which the teacher is able to adapt on-going
    teaching to meet the unique learning needs of individual children.
