The variables which determine what counts as sufficient practice have
been described in an earlier chapter. In brief, the number of practice
responses which the learner must experience in order to ensure that a
given response, skill, idea, or understanding will be remembered depend
upon

-   the way in which these are scheduled in time -- with a greatly
    increased likelihood of a new response being remembered if practice
    opportunities with that response occur no more than 48 hours apart,
-   the type of learning outcome which is to be achieved -- with the
    learning of new knowledge and new generalisations requiring much
    less practice than is required for the acquisition of new skills and
    operations
-   the meaningfulness of what is being learned -- with meaningful
    ideas, concepts and generalisations requiring much less practice
    than is required in order to learn and remember less meaningful
    responses such as details, unrelated facts, new names, irregular
    spellings, non-meaningful conventions, and so on
-   the level of proficiency, fluency, or automaticity required -- with
    functional levels of fluency requiring much more reinforced practice
    than is required for initial acquisition.
