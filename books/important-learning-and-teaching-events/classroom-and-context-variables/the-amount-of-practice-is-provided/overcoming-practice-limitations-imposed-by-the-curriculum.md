# Overcoming practice limitations imposed by the curriculum

The curriculum for any given year level contains far more than the
average child could possibly learn and remember in a year. This means
that either certain topics and skills have to be left out or else the
time spent on many of the topics must be severely limited. In general,
teachers choose the latter course of action over the former and this
greatly reduces the amount of practice which is possible and hence
greatly reduces what is actually remembered by students.

This variable, although it has no agreed name, might be referred to as
*curriculum density.* Because the amount and scheduling of practice is a
strong determinant of what is learned by individual students, developing
measures of curriculum density, and tracking curriculum density is
obviously an operation of some importance during any attempt to study
the effects of teaching on learning in the classroom.
