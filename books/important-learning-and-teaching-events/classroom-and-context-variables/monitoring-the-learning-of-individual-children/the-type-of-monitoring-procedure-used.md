# The type of monitoring procedure used

Many different procedures are used for monitoring student progress
towards particular teaching goals: the daily probes used in Precision
Teaching, the weekly tests used in Curriculum Based Measurement, the
periodic running records used in early reading teaching, the weekly
spelling test, and so on. Even when a particular procedure has been
selected, it may be administered in different ways by different
teachers. For example some teachers take untimed running records of
early reading and record only reading accuracy while others take timed
running records and record both accuracy and fluency. More recently,
teaching researchers have begun to develop computer administered daily
probes which students can use first to test themselves, then to enter
their test results, and finally to print out a graph showing their
current rate of progress towards particular learning outcomes.

Different monitoring procedures require differing amounts of work on the
part of the teacher, and teachers vary with respect to the motivation
and the knowledge which they bring to the monitoring task. This produces
very considerable variability across classrooms and, presumably, very
considerable variability in the effects of these practices on student
learning.
