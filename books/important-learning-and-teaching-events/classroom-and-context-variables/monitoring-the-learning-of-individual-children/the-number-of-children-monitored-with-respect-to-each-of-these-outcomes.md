It is quite impossible for a single teacher to monitor the progress of
25 to 30 students on a daily basis. Teachers attempt to solve this
problem in a variety of ways: by teaching students how to self-evaluate
and self-record their performance, by sampling the students who will be
observed or tested each day, by getting students to work in pairs to
test each other, by setting up computer systems in which the students
themselves can enter the results of daily or weekly probes, and so on.
All of these procedures introduce additional variability into classroom
practice and into the effects of that practice on student learning.
