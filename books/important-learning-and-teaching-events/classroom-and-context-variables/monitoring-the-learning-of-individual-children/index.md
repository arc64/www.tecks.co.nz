Teachers who attempt to adapt teaching procedures and learning
activities on the basis of reliable data about the progress which is
being made by individual students tend to be more effective in helping
children achieve particular achievement goals. This kind of adaptive
teaching practice is only possible if the teacher has the skills and the
equipment which is required in order to monitor the progress of 25 to 30
students simultaneously. However, the task of monitoring the learning of
large numbers of students is such a complex task that very considerable
variations in monitoring procedures can exist from classroom to
classroom. Progress monitoring can vary along any of three separate
dimensions: the type of monitoring procedure used, the particular
achievement outcomes which are monitored, and the number of children who
are monitored.
