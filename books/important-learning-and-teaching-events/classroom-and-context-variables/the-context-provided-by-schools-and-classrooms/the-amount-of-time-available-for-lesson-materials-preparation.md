# The amount of time available for lesson materials preparation

Teachers experience many conflicting demands on their time: classroom
teaching, assisting with the administration of the school, attending
professional development activities, supervising extra curricular
activities, attending to playground supervision, meeting with parents,
marking, materials preparation and so on. Because teachers have to
produce many of their own teaching resources, the time available for
materials preparation becomes a critical determinant of student progress
when teaching occurs in classrooms.

*Preparation time.* The time available for materials preparation is
relatively easy to measure. It is simply the time remaining, out of an
1,800 hour year, after all other work related responsibilities have been
attended to.
