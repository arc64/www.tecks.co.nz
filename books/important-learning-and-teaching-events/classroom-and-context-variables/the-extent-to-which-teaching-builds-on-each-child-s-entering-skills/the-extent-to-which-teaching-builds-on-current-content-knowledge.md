Effective teaching involves the selection of developmentally appropriate
teaching goals, that is teaching goals which build upon those curriculum
relevant skills which have already been acquired without assuming
mastery of any curriculum relevant skills which have not yet been
acquired. Since the learning histories of the students in a class are a
given, this means that teaching goals must be selected which are
appropriate to the entering skills of each learner. The first step in
this process is to complete a task analysis of the new skill which is to
be taught and then to identify those students who have and have not yet
mastered each of the skills identified by the task analysis.

A task analysis of the skill "adding common fractions", for example,
would identify the following component skills:

1Is able to add and multiply quantities from 1 to 10 with reasonable
fluency

2.Is able to demonstrate an understanding of fractional numbers (perhaps
by drawing a diagram of the part representing the whole number and the
part represented by the fraction)

3.Is able to read the symbols for common fractions

4.Is able to distinguish between expressions requiring addition and
those requiring some other operation (e.g. multiplication)

5.Is able to distinguish between fractions which contain common
denominators and those which do not

6.Is able to convert fractions with unlike denominators to fractions
with common denominators

7.Is able to add fractions (by adding the numerators and writing the sum
over the common denominator) and to state the rule which governs this
operation

8.Is able to discriminate between expressions which can be simplified
and those which cannot be simplified

9.Is able to simplify expressions

The teacher might be of the view that her students can already perform
Steps 1 to 4 and that instruction can start at Step 5. When the prior
knowledge of the students is checked, this check will identify two
groups of students: (a) those who have and (b) those who have not yet
mastered all of the prerequisite skills. In the case of the second
group, there is only one *effective* course of action and that is to
*change the teaching aim for that student*. The teacher must pause and
take the time to ensure that the student in question acquires and
masters the missing prerequisite skill or understanding. Using the
fraction addition example above, pre-testing might reveal one or more
students who have not yet acquired a generalised understanding of the
concept of a fraction (Step 2). These students would need to be taught
this understanding before they were introduced to the procedure for
adding fractions otherwise they will not understand the procedure.

When pre-testing reveals considerable numbers of students who have yet
to acquire the prerequisites assumed by a particular achievement
objective, we commonly refer to this feature of classroom life as *the
level of diversity* in the classroom. In an earlier section we talked
about the additional work involved in coping with increasing levels of
diversity at the programme level (e.g. the reading programme or the
maths programme). In this section we are talking about the extra work
which is involved in coping with increasing levels of diversity at the
level of the lesson or topic.

The greater the degree of diversity amongst the students in a classroom
the greater the work which is involved in developing teaching resources
and learning activities for each of the different groups of students,
and teachers vary with respect to their motivation and their ability to
cope with this increasing complexity. This variability affects the
learning which will result from particular lessons and learning
activities and is, therefore, an important variable which needs to be
taken into account during any study of the effects of teaching on
learning in the classroom.
