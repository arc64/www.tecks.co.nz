One of the important understandings which has arisen from the research
into contingencies of reinforcement and punishment is that it is
possible not only for appropriate behaviour to generate reinforcement
but also for errors, inappropriate behaviour, and antisocial behaviour
to generate reinforcement as well. Only the teacher who understands the
difference between the main reinforcement and punishment contingencies
and their effects will be in a position to respond effectively to these
commonly occurring causes of misbehaviour and declining motivation in
the classroom.
