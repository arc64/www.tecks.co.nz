It is also possible for inappropriate child behaviour to be negatively
reinforced. A child may throw a tantrum in an attempt to avoid
completing a particular task and this tantrum may work to avoid the task
-- with the result that tantrumming is inadvertently (negatively)
reinforced. A child may lie to avoid punishment. If the lie works, lying
will have been negatively reinforced. A second major cause of behaviour
problems in children of all ages occurs when the child discovers that
inappropriate behaviour works to avoid having to do something which they
do not want to do.
