There is a third contingency which may cause a behaviour to *decrease in
frequency* (to be used less often). Let us say that a behaviour has been
used in the past because, in the past, it has worked to produce
reinforcement. But the environment changes so that, when this behaviour
is used, it longer works to produce reinforcement. When this happens,
the behaviour which previously produced reinforcement (but which now
doesn\'t) may decline in frequency or even cease to be used. When the
reinforcement for a particular behaviour is removed either as a result
of a change in the environment, or as an intentional management
strategy, the behaviour is said to have been placed on an *extinction
contingency*.

Extinction contingencies are sometimes referred to as extinction, for
short. There are two types of extinction contingencies: (a) extinction
following the removal of positive reinforcement and (b) extinction
following the removal of negative reinforcement. For example, a teacher
might use much praise during the initial acquisition phase of learning a
new skill and then cease to provide this encouragement. If performance
of the new skill then declined in frequency this would be an example of
extinction following the withdrawal of positive reinforcement. Or a
teacher might cease to check homework (and to reprimand the learners who
fail to complete the homework) only to find that homework completion
declines in frequency. This is an example of extinction following the
withdrawal of negative reinforcement. The behaviour has declined in
frequency because performance of the behaviour (completing homework) is
no longer necessary in order to avoid punishment (teacher disapproval).
