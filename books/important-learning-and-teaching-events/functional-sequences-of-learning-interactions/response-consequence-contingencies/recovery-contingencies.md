There is a third contingency which may cause a behaviour to *increase in
frequency* (to be used more often). There are some behaviours which we
do not engage in because, to engage in them might produce punishment,
disapproval, or sanctions of some kind. Behaviours which have been
suppressed by punishment, may recover and begin to be used again if the
environment changes in a way which makes it clear that the behaviour in
question is no longer going to be punished.

Take, for example, the behaviour of drawing a pretty border around each
page of work. Let us say that this behaviour was learned in Year 5 and
the following year the child moved into a class where the teacher
prohibited this behaviour. The behaviour (drawing borders) was
suppressed (in Year 6) because, if it was engaged in, it produced a
major reprimand from the teacher. The following year (Year 7) the child
moves into a new class where borders are no longer prohibited (and,
therefore, no longer punished). Under these conditions, the child might
well begin once again to engage in this behaviour (because it no longer
generates an aversive outcome). If this happened, the reappearance of
the behaviour of drawing borders would be an instance of *recovery*.
