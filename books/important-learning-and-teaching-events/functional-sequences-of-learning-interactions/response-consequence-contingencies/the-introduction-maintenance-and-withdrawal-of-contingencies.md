When an action is being engaged in repeatedly over time, the
consequences of that action may change. The action may initially have no
consequence but, over time may come to have a consistent consequence.
For example, a child who has just been admitted to preschool may attempt
to engage in co-operative play but these attempts may initially meet
with little success. As the days go by, however, these attempts may
increasingly result in opportunities to engage in co-operative play with
other children.

A second possibility is that a new response, behaviour or action, once
mastered may consistently produce much the same consequence or effect.
For example, once a child has learned to read, the reading activity
consistently results in sensory stimulation, usually results in
understanding and very often results in enjoyment.

A third possibility is that, over time, a given action may cease to
produce the consequences which it previously produced. For example, a
child who is trying to master skate boarding may initially experience
many painful falls but, as the child become more competent, fewer and
fewer skate boarding attempts result in painful falls.

These observations remind us that the relationship between behaviour and
its consequences is a reciprocal relationship. Particular behaviours
have outcomes and these outcomes affect the likelihood of the learner
using that behaviour again in the future. Over time, contingencies of
reinforcement and punishment gradually shape the performance of the
learner resulting in a person who habitually behaves in certain ways,
but not others, in particular circumstances.
