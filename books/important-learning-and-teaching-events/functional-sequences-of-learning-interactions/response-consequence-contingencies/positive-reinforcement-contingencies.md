# Positive reinforcement contingencies

A particular response or behaviour can *produce* an outcome. It can make
something happen. It can add something to our environment. The learner
may work carefully, get all their answers correct, and get a merit
certificate from the teacher for "excellent work". In this case the
behaviour (responding correctly) has produced a consequence (produced a
certificate). If this contingency continues to operate, and the number
of correct answers produced by the learner is maintained, or increased,
then this response-consequence relationship meets the definition of a
*positive reinforcement contingency.* Positive reinforcement
contingencies are often referred to as reinforcement for short.

Positive reinforcement contingencies are defined as follows.

*If* (a) a behaviour begins to *produce* an event,

and (b) the behaviour *increases* in frequency

*then*

\(a\) the event is a *reinforcer*,

and(b) the contingency is a *positive reinforcement* contingency

Note that positive reinforcement contingencies also motivate continued
use of a behaviour once that behaviour has been acquired.

Positive reinforcement contingencies are extremely common in everyday
life. Large amounts of our behaviour are maintained from day to day by
the reinforcing outcomes which that behaviour has for us. This is true
of all of those activities which we engage in because of the enjoyment
which they generate: listening to particular compact disks, watching
particular TV programmes, reading particular types of books, spending
time in the company of particular friends, and so on. It includes all
those behaviours which we engage in because we get paid for doing so.
And it includes all those behaviours which work to provide intellectual
stimulation, to keep us warm, to satisfy hunger and to satisfy other
bodily needs.
