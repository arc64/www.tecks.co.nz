Some contingencies (response-consequence relationships) have a
strengthening effect. They make it *more likely* that a particular
behaviour will be remembered and used again (under similar
circumstances) in the future. Contingencies which have this
strengthening effect are referred to as *reinforcement contingencies.*

Other contingencies have a weakening effect. They *reduce* the
likelihood of the learner using that particular behaviour again in the
future. They teach us a lesson and the lesson is **not** ** to make that
mistake again next time. ** In the scientific literature on learning,
contingencies which have a weakening or suppressive effect are referred
to as *punishment contingencies*.
