# Time based schedules versus response based schedules

The third way in which schedules of reinforcement and punishment can
vary is with respect to type: ratio or interval. A ratio schedule is one
in which a certain number of responses are necessary in order to produce
reinforcement. An example might be the poorly motivated child who is
earning reinforcement for the number of lines written or the number of
exercises completed.

An interval schedule is one where reinforcement occurs only after a
certain amount of time has passed. An example might be the poorly
motivated child who is being checked from time to time and who can earn
reinforcement if she is working at the time when the check is made. In
this case any reinforcement which can be earned depends upon the time
interval rather than upon the number of responses which have been made
by the child.
