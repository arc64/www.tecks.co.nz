# Predictable versus unpredictable schedules

Particular behaviours and actions may generate reinforcement in a
predictable or unpredictable manner. If the teacher always marks a
pupil\'s maths exercises at the conclusion of every maths lesson, any
reinforcement (or punishment) which is produced as a result will occur
in a highly predictable manner. Schedules of reinforcement in which the
reinforcement is predictable are usually referred to as *fixed
schedules*.

More commonly, however, reinforcement (and punishment) does not occur in
such a predictable manner. The teacher may sometimes mark the maths and
sometimes not. Schedules of reinforcement in which the reinforcement is
unpredictable are referred to as *variable schedules.*
