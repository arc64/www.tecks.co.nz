# The move from continuous to intermittent schedules of consequences

During the initial phases of instruction it is often considered
desirable to provide some kind of feedback following every attempt to
perform a new response, that is, it is considered desirable to provide
differential reinforcement on a continuous schedule. Later in the
teaching sequence, however, the teacher may check practice responses
only from time to time (perhaps as a check to ensure that the student
has remembered the correct response). The procedure which the teacher
uses to make this transition from continuous reinforcement to
intermittent reinforcement is obviously an instructional variable of
some importance. Currently however, this transition (from continuous to
intermittent reinforcement) has no agreed name.
