# The interspersal ratio

A practice set may consist of responses, skills or understandings which
have already been acquired (but which still need further practice). Or
it may consist of responses which have yet to be acquired. Or it may
consist of a mixture of previously acquired and yet to be acquired
responses. The simplest way of defining a practice set which consists of
a mixture of learned and yet to be learned items is in terms of the
interspersal ratio. *The interspersal ratio refers to the ratio of yet
to be learned to previously learned responses in the practice set for a
particular lesson, learning activity or practice session.*

The interspersal ratio is not the same as the accuracy level during
practice. The interspersal ratio refers to the ratio of yet to be
mastered responses compared to previously acquired responses (as
determined during previous practice sessions or tests). The accuracy
level during practice refers to the proportion of practice responses
which are correct compared to the total (correct plus incorrect)
practice responses during the current practice session.
