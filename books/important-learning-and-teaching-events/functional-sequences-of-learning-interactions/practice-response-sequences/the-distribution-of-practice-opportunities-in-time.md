# The distribution of practice opportunities in time

The practice opportunities which are necessary for learning and
remembering may be distributed across time in a wide variety of ways --
clumped together in a single learning activity, spread across several
days, or distributed across many months. It is now known that the
learning of a new response, skill or understanding depends not only on
the number of practice opportunities involving that response but also on
the time which elapses between successive practice opportunities
involving that response. There is evidence that mammalian brains
continue to process new experiences for up to 24 hours (Rose, 1993).
There is also evidence to suggest that, during the acquisition phase,
new responses are likely to be remembered when practice opportunities
are less than 2 days apart but not when practice opportunities are more
than 2 days apart (Nuthall, 1999; Nuthall & Alton-Lee, 1993).

There was some indication that this might be the case in the earlier
research into massed versus spaced practice. The term "spaced practice"
refers to the use of regular (e.g. daily) short practice sessions.
"Massed practice" refers to the use of less frequent (e.g. weekly) but
longer practice sessions. The research into massed and spaced practice
long ago demonstrated that both children and adults make more rapid
progress in learning a set of new responses or skills when practice time
is distributed across short daily practice sessions than when that same
time is spent in a single longer practice session such as a weekly
practice session (Dempster, 1991). We now know that this is probably
because the brain retains the capacity to remember initial practice
responses for a day or two but not for any longer.

Although the scheduling of practice opportunities has important effects
on learning, there exist no agreed terms for describing the scheduling
of practice opportunities (which involve the same response) across time
and no agreed way of quantifying variations in the scheduling of
response opportunities across time. We cannot use the older terms
"massed" and "spaced" practice because these terms are too imprecise.
The lack of a procedure for measuring and describing the distribution of
practice responses in time is a major impediment to the scientific study
of learning and teaching.

To summarise, effective teaching involves knowing not only how many
practice opportunities are required in order to learn and remember a new
response, skill, or understanding but also how these must be distributed
in time. This means that research into learning and teaching must
control and describe not only (a) the number of practice opportunities
which occurred with respect to each response, skill or item of
information being taught but also (b) the distribution of each of these
practice opportunities in time for each individual learner.
