Sooner or later, the teacher will decide that a given response, skill or
understanding has received sufficient practice and will move the student
on to the next topic or set of skills specified by the curriculum. Exit
criteria are referred to using a variety of terms "performance
criteria", "mastery criteria", "fluency criteria", "promotion criteria"
and so on.

Amount of practice can be described both for classroom purposes and
research purposes in a variety of ways: (a) by specifying the number of
minutes spent in practice, (b) by specifying the number of practice
responses engaged in during practice or (c) by specifying the fluency
criterion which had to be achieved in order to exit from practice. The
first measure (time spent) is never a satisfactory measure because
different learners complete different numbers of practice responses
during a given period of time. The third measure (practice to a given
level of fluency) has the advantage of allowing the teacher and the
teaching researcher to measure both the effectiveness and the efficiency
of the teaching or practice procedure under examination. The advantage,
for teachers, of using a fluency criterion as the criterion for deciding
when to move a child on to the next step in the curriculum is that
fluency criteria can be objectively specified and the level of fluency
which a child has reached can be objectively measured.
