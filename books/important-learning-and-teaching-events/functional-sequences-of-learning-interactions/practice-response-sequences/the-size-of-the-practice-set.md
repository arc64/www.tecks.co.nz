# The size of the practice set

When students are acquiring or practising new responses the number of
different responses in the set of practice responses may vary from one
to many dozens. For example, a child might be given the task of learning
or practising a single spelling word, a set of five new spelling words,
or a set of 10 new words. The term "practice set" refers to the set of
different responses which the learner is expected to study or practice
during a single lesson or practice session and the term "size of the
practice set" refers to the number of different responses which the
learner is expected to practice during a single session.

The size of the practice set is a critical learning variable for two
reasons. First, the practice set needs to be greater than working memory
capacity otherwise the child may be able to respond to practice stimuli
from working memory with little learning occurring as a result. Second,
working memory increases with age which means that the size of the
practice set also needs to increase with age.
