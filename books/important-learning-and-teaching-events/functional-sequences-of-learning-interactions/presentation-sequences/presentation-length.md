Presentations consist of curriculum relevant statements, propositions,
or claims about some topic. The expectation of the person doing the
presentation is that the learners will attend to the presentation.
Presentations can be of any length from a single proposition to a 50
minute lecture. Presentation length may be defined in terms of the
amount of material presented by the teacher from the end of one practice
response to the beginning of the next practice response. The amount of
material presented can be measured in terms of the number of
propositions contained in the presentation under examination.

Presentation length is an extremely important teaching variable given
that young children can only hold the content of one meaningful
proposition in working memory at a time and even adult learners can only
hold three or four propositions in working memory at any one time. Above
this, propositions which might have been processed or rehearsed (and
possibly remembered) are simply displaced by the incoming content of
subsequent presentations.
