Presentations about concepts and principles also tend to include
non-examples of the concept or principle under examination. Non-examples
are important instructional events because they can teach the learner
what the concept is not. The number of non-examples may vary from a
single non-example to a set of non-examples. A set of non-examples may
consist of instances which are widely different from the examples used
or they may consist of close-in non-examples. Close-in non-examples are
instances which are similar to the positive examples which are being
referred to in the presentation.

The number and type of non-examples used in a sequence of presentations
is a matter of some importance because this variable plays a critical
role in preventing the development of misconceptions about the concept
which is being discussed. If the non-examples selected to show what the
concept is not are widely dissimilar to the examples (rather than being
close-in non-examples), the learner may develop an overgeneralised
understanding of the new concept.
