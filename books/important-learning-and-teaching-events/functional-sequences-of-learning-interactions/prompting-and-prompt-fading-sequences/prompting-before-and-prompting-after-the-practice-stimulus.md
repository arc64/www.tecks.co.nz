# Prompting before and prompting after the practice stimulus

Wherever possible it is considered good practice to first present the
practice stimulus and only then to present the prompt. This is because,
if the prompt is presented *before* the practice stimulus is presented,
the pupil may respond to the prompt (instead of responding to the
practice stimulus) and may fail to learn how to respond to the practice
stimulus when no prompt is provided. Although this procedure (presenting
the practice stimulus and then presenting the prompt) is considered to
be good practice, it has yet to be given an agreed name.

There are, of course, some situations where the prompt has to be
presented prior to presentation of the practice stimulus. When showing a
child how to catch a ball the demonstration (the prompt) must be
provided before throwing the ball to the child (the practice stimulus)
because it cannot be provided after the ball has been thrown.
