# Prompting and prompt fading sequences

Most new skills are acquired only after a certain amount of practice.
This means that a sequence of prompted practice responses will normally
be required in order to teach a new skill. One of the characteristics of
skilled performance, however, is the ability to respond independently,
that is, without prompting. So, if prompts are used during the initial
phases of instruction then, eventually, they must be removed from the
practice situation so that the learner receives the opportunity to
engage in unprompted practice. The task of withdrawing prompts during
practice is most commonly referred to as *fading* and this is the term
which will be used in this account.
