When someone is learning how to perform a new operation or procedure,
the teacher may demonstrate, describe or otherwise prompt one step at a
time, or several steps at a time, or all of the steps in the procedure.
There is little agreement as to what the "number of steps prompted at
one time" should be called. Margolius and Sheffield (1961) referred to
this variable as the learner\'s *demonstration-assimilation span* but
this term has not caught on. Although there is no agreed term for this
variable, it is nevertheless an important teaching variable for two
reasons. Because young children can only hold one or two steps in mind
at a time, the number of steps which are prompted at once is an
important determinant of how quickly the new procedure will be acquired.
The size of the demonstration-assimilation span also needs to vary as
practice progresses. During the initial stages of instruction in a new
procedure, the demonstration-assimilation span may need to be limited to
two or three steps at a time. As the learner begins to master some of
the steps in the sequence of responses, the demonstration-assimilation
span can be, and usually is, increased.
