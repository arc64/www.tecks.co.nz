Chapter 4 described the important components of a single learning
interaction, the various values which these components can take, and the
varied functions which each can perform. Of course, very little is
learned as a result of a single learning interaction. New skills and
understandings develop as a function of experiences which consist of a
number of learning interactions distributed over time. In order to
develop an understanding of what the word "yellow" means, the young
child must experience many learning opportunities with yellow objects.
These may be spread out over several months.

We will refer to the occurrence, on a number of occasions, or repeated
opportunities to practise a given behaviour or skill as a *sequence of
learning interactions*. Sequences of learning interactions serve many
important functions: maintaining motivation, developing understanding,
shaping increased levels of skill, ensuring that new skills are
remembered, developing independence, building fluency, and so on.

Chapter 5 describes some of the ways in which sequences of learning
interactions can vary -- especially those variations which are known to
affect motivation, acquisition, remembering, independence and fluency.

Chapter 5 consists of eight sections. Section 1 describes some of the
ways in which presentation sequences can vary, Section 2 describes some
of the different kinds of prompting sequences and prompt fading
sequences which can occur, Section 3 describes a number of commonly
occurring types of practice sequences, Sections 4 and 5 describe a
number of different types of response-consequence contingencies,
Sections 6 describes different types of schedules of reinforcement and
punishment and Section 7 identifies three important types of contingency
errors (contingencies which have effects which differ from those
intended).
