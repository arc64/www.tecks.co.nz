Studies of learning and teaching based on cognitive theorising and using
a social science methodology have been appearing in research journals
for over 100 years. Notwithstanding recent developments in both
qualitative and behaviour analysis methods, social science procedures
remain the dominant research procedures which are being used to study
learning and teaching (Church, 1998).

First impressions of the social science research into learning and
teaching suggest that this kind of research has been relatively
productive. Somewhere between 25,000 and 50,000 manuscripts a year are
submitted to 350 separate psychology journals (Machado, Lourenço &
Silva, 2000). Several dozen meta-analyses of the research into various
teaching variables have been published and there now exist several
reviews of these meta-analyses (e.g. Lipsey & Wilson, 1993; Walberg,
1986; Walberg & Wang, 1987). The social science research in a number of
fields (child development, special education, teaching, teacher
education, and so on) has been summarised in encyclopaedia length
treatments (e.g. Damon, 1998; Wang, Reynolds & Walberg, 1987; Wittrock,
1986). And the most popular educational psychology textbooks (which rely
primarily on the results of the social science research into learning
and teaching) are substantial text books which have been through many
editions (e.g. Gage & Berliner, 1998; Slavin, 1999; Elliott, Kratochwill
& Cook, 1999).

Closer reading of these encyclopaedias and textbooks, however, reveals a
number of features which are not immediately apparent. To a large
extent, the encyclopaedias of research are not so much summaries of
research as discussions of the various competing theories which have
been advanced to account for perception, cognitive processing, memory,
learning, and the development of different kinds of competencies. In the
educational psychology textbooks, the material on teaching consists
primarily of common sense notions of how to teach buttressed from time
to time by reference to a research study which supports that common
sense notion. As in the encyclopaedias, material on learning is almost
always presented from a variety of theoretical orientations:
developmental views of learning, behaviour-analytic views of learning,
information processing views of learning, and so on. Thirdly, an
analysis of the research citations in both the encyclopaedias and the
textbooks indicates that where research based generalisations are being
advanced, they are often based upon the results of very small number of
empirical investigations - sometimes just a single investigation. In
short, "voluminous productivity should not be confused with progress"
(Machado, Lourenço & Silva, 2000).

A number of observers (e.g. Heward & Cooper, 1992; Johnston &
Pennypacker, 1993; Mouly, 1970; Phillips, 1980) have noted that only
very modest progress in theory development has occurred in cognitive
science with multiple conflicting theories being the norm. This is a
fairly modest accomplishment - given that social and cognitive
scientists have been studying the effects of different teaching
variables and procedures, and have been trying to identify the variables
of which learning is a function, for almost a century. (It certainly
falls well short of the social scientist's aim to develop general
theories of learning and of teaching.) As several critics have noted,
research into learning using the methods of social science has resulted
in the collection of a large amount of data but absolutely no consensus
regarding theory (or even the organising concepts) which might be used
to integrate all that data (Bauer, 1992; Gellner, 1984; Machado,
Lourenço & Silva, 2000).
