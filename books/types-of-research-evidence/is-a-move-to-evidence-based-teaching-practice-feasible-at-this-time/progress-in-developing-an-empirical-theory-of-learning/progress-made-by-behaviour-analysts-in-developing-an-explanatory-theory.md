Behaviour analytic studies of learning and teaching first began to
appear in the educational literature in 1964 and, over the intervening
period of not much more than 40 years, behaviour analysts have made good
progress in developing a useful procedure for classifying both different
types of learning and different types of variables which affect
learning. Both of these classifications are functional classifications.
Particular classes of events, experiences, and teaching variables are
admitted as classes of events which are worth distinguishing only when
they have been shown (as a result of experimental analysis) to have
predictable effects on the motivation, the performance, or some aspect
of the learning of individuals (Catania, 1998; Johnston & Pennypacker,
1993). (This is a key difference between the development of behaviour
analysis and the development of cognitive science.)

In 1990 some 60,223 people belonged to the American Psychological
Association while only 2,121 (less than 4%) belonged to the Association
for Behaviour Analysis (Heward & Cooper, 1992). In spite of their
relatively small numbers, behaviour analysts have made good progress in
identifying a number of elements of an inductively derived theory of
learning. In behaviour analysis, the integrating statements which have
been developed to date are usually referred to as *principles of
behaviour*. These principles of behaviour, together with examples of the
research from which they are derived, constitute the central content of
most behaviour analysis textbooks (e.g. Catania, 1998; Cooper, Heron &
Heward, 1987; Grant & Evans, 1994; Malott, Whaley & Malott, 1993). The
reader who compares the content of behaviour analysis textbooks will
find that the references in these textbooks are mostly references to
primary sources (that is, to actual experiments) rather than references
to secondary sources and theoretical works as is the case in most
cognitively oriented educational psychology texts. There is also a very
close degree of agreement across all recently written behaviour analysis
textbooks with respect to the technical terms employed, the way in which
these terms are defined, and the way in which they are used.

Thirdly, a cumulative development is occurring within behaviour analysis
research. There is an evolutionary progression in behaviour analysis
textbooks with later textbooks covering a wider set of behaviour
principles than earlier textbooks. Textbooks, written by behaviour
analysts, have appeared for students of child development (e.g.
Schlinger, 1995), students of psychology (e.g. Schlinger & Poling,
1998), student teachers (e.g. Sulzer-Azaroff & Mayer, 1991), and special
education teachers (e.g. Wolery, Bailey & Sugai, 1988). In not much more
than 40 years, behaviour analysts have succeeded in identifying a number
of the variables which affect motivation, the acquisition of new
behaviours and skills, and the retention of new skills over time; and
they have begun to delineate the conditions under which these variables
operate.

Because behaviour analytic theory is an inductively derived theory (that
is, a theory derived from the data) and the principles of behaviour are
generalisations about the functional relationships which exist between
environmental events and behaviour change, it comes as no surprise to
find that behaviour analysts have been very productive in designing
effective procedures for motivating people, for teaching people new
skills and understandings, for helping people overcome fears and
anxieties, for managing inappropriate behaviour and antisocial
behaviour, for accelerating the development of people with disabling
conditions, and so on. For example, the most effective interventions for
helping people overcome phobias and anxieties involve procedures like
systematic desensitisation which have been derived from basic research
into the respondent conditioning process (Barlow, 1988; Ollendick &
King, 1998). The contingency management procedures which have been found
to be most effective in teaching children to respond in prosocial rather
than antisocial ways in their interactions with others have been derived
by behaviour analysts from basic research into differential
reinforcement processes (Brestan & Eyberg, 1998; Church, 2003). Many of
the teaching procedures which have been found to be most effective in
accelerating the progress of low achieving children and children with
learning disabilities have been designed by behaviour analysts (Lloyd,
1988). The names of behaviour analysts also figure prominently in
discussions of cures for stuttering (Gillon & Schwartz, 1998; Onslow,
Menzies & Packman, 2001), cures for toilet training failures (e.g. Foxx
& Azrin, 1973), and so on. Mention should also be made of the many
innovative practices developed by behaviour analysts to accelerate the
development of children with intellectual disabilities (Snell, 1997) and
children with autism spectrum disorders (Rogers, 1998).
