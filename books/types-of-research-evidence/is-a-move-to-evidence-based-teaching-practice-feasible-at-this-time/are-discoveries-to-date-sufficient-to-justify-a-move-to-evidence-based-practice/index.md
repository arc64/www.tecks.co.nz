There is little point in arguing that "teaching should be based on
research" if there is little or no reliable research-based data into how
children acquire different kinds of skills and understandings and how
these kinds of learning might best be facilitated by teachers. This
raises the question of whether our research endeavours have reached the
point where we have accumulated sufficient reliable, research-based
knowledge about learning and teaching to begin the transition from
teaching practices based solely on classroom experience, to teaching
practices which are informed by both research and experience. Have we
yet made sufficient progress in identifying the conditions necessary for
learning to use this knowledge to guide the development of effective
teaching practice? Has our understanding of the conditions necessary for
learning reached the point where this understanding is stimulating
technological advances in teaching methods, materials, and programmes?
Has our ability to explain (and hence predict) teaching effects
developed to the point where we could possibly make research-based
decisions regarding the kinds of classroom teaching activities which
will work best to foster the mastery of different curriculum goals by
individual children at different levels of development?
