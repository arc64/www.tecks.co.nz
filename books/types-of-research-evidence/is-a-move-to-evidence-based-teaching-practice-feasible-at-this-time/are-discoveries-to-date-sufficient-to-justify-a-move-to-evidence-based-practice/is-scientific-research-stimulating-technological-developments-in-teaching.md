Not only has the scientific research into learning identified many of
the conditions upon which learning depends, it has also stimulated very
considerable research into the development of teaching programmes which
are more effective and which work for larger numbers of students than is
the case with current classroom teaching programmes. Much of this
technological development can be attributed to the applied research of
behaviour analysts. "Perhaps in the history of education or psychology,
no other comparatively small minority of scientists/scholars has made
such advancements in practical applications to significant human
behavior within such a short time" (Heward & Cooper, 1992, p. 357).
Scientifically-based technological developments in teaching include
programmes which result in more rapid progress across all learners than
is currently the case, reading programmes which are effective in
teaching almost all children to read in a timely fashion, maths
programmes which are more effective in teaching maths to all children,
interventions which are effective in treating anxiety disorders,
interventions which are effective in treating disruptive and antisocial
behaviour disorders in children, and so on.

**Technological developments which accelerate progress through the
curriculum**

By combining the discoveries listed in the preceding section in novel
ways, scientifically oriented educational researchers have developed
instructional systems which are much more effective than anything
previously reported in the educational research literature (e.g. Gardner
et al., 1994; Moran & Malott, 2004). These measurably superior teaching
arrangements include Classwide Peer Tutoring (Greenwood, Delquadri &
Hall, 1989; Greenwood et al., 1987), Direct Instruction (Binder &
Watkins, 1990; Kinder & Carnine, 1991), Precision Teaching (Binder &
Watkins, 1990; Lindsley, 1991), Generative Instruction (Johnson & Layng,
1994), the Comprehensive Application of Behaviour Analysis to Schooling
(CABAS) programme (Greer, 1994; Lam & Greer, 1991; Selinske, Greer &
Lodhi, 1991), decision rule systems (Liberty & Haring 1990; Fuchs, Fuchs
and Hamlet, 1994), and the Personalised System of Instruction (Sherman,
Ruskin & Semb, 1982).

Each of these teaching programmes has produced large gains for the
children taking part. Two- to four-fold increases in the rates of
progress of individual students are commonly reported (e.g. Greer, 1994;
Johnson & Layng, 1994). Each of these programmes has produced large
gains across individual learners, across teachers, and across time.

**Teaching programmes which are effective for** ***all*** **children**

More importantly, both behaviour analysts and cognitive scientists have
demonstrated that it is possible to design programmes to teach reading,
maths, and so on which are effective for almost all children. For
example there are now a number of reading programmes which result in 95%
of children learning to read in a timely fashion rather than the 80%
which currently occurs in New Zealand, and reading programmes which
reduce the need for one-to-one tutoring from 20% of the Year 2 cohort to
5% (Church, 2005). Programmes which have proven effective for all
children (including low achieving children and children from
impoverished environments) include the Direct Instruction Reading
programmes (Adams & Engelmann, 1996) and the Success for All Reading
programme (Hopkins, Youngman, Harris & Wordsworth, 2000; Slavin &
Madden, 2001).

**Technological developments in teaching children with special teaching
needs**

The 1998 issue of the *Journal of Clinical Child Psychology* which
reviewed the then current state of development in remedial treatments
for children with special needs showed that very considerable progress
had been made with respect to the design of effective treatments for
children with special teaching needs. In that particular issue, Kaslow
and Thompson (1988) identified a number of probably efficacious
interventions for children and teenagers with depression, Ollendick and
King (1998) identified a number of well established treatments for
children with anxiety disorders, Brestan and Eyberg (1998) identified
several well-established treatments for children with disruptive and
antisocial behaviour difficulties, and Rogers (1998) reviewed the
research into the effectiveness of various teaching programmes for
children with autism. Not only were effective interventions identified
for each of these groups of children, many qualified as well
established, and all had been derived by behaviour analysts from basic
research into the conditions responsible for the development of these
types of developmental problems.

Other reviewers have identified effective interventions for children
with intellectual disabilities (Snell, 1997), for children with
stuttering and other types of speech disorders (Gillon & Schwartz, 1998)
and have extended the findings of the 1998 reviews to identify effective
interventions for children with antisocial behaviour difficulties at
various age levels (Church, 2005).

**Research which demonstrates the possibility of scientifically oriented
clinical teaching research**

One of the defining characteristics of the within-subject approach to
experimentation is that it is a method which can be situated *in*
teaching and used to evaluate the effects of particular teaching methods
on learning *during the course of teaching* (Church, 1975, 1996). In
other words, the repeated measures, within-subject experimental
procedures are ideally suited for scientifically oriented clinical
teaching research in the classroom. This makes it the most powerful of
the various research methods currently available to teachers.

For the first time in the history of research on teaching it is now
possible for classroom teachers to move beyond the action research, the
narrative research and the qualitative research to which they have been
limited and for them to develop forms of practitioner research which are
more closely akin to the clinical research and clinical experimentation
which characterises the more mature professions such as medicine. Unlike
previous forms of practitioner research which were largely narrative and
descriptive, the new clinical teaching research can be experimental and
this creates considerable potential to stimulate improvements in
teaching practice.

Single subject methodology is well suited for teacher research in
schools since it can be situated in ongoing instruction. In fact, it is
employed as an evaluation strategy in just that way in many special
education programs. Data from these evaluations, collected by teachers
in their classrooms with their students, influences choices about
program planning for individuals and for overall curriculum design. . .
. This methodology provides practice-oriented ways for field-based
personnel to learn more about what is effective - and what is not - in
what they do (Neuman & McCormick, 1995, p. 29).
