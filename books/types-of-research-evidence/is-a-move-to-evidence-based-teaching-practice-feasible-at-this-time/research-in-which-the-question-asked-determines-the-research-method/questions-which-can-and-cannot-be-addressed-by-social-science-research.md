The group-statistical methods of the social scientist also have a useful
role to play in research into learning and teaching. Because social
scientists study the performance of groups of people, the social science
methodology is well suited to finding the answers to questions about
groups or populations of learners, teachers, classrooms, or schools.

The research procedures of the social scientist are the appropriate
procedures to use when seeking the answer to epidemiological and
prevalence questions. A social science procedure would be the
appropriate procedure for finding out the proportion of children who
engage in antisocial or disruptive behaviour in the classroom, or the
proportion of children who are more than two years delayed in learning
to read, for example.

Social science procedures can also be used to compare the prevalence of
a particular characteristic in various subgroups of learners (to compare
the prevalence of children with behaviour problems at different age
levels, for example); or to compare the prevalence of particular
characteristics at various points in time (to compare the prevalence of
first grade children with behaviour problems at 10 year intervals, for
example); or to compare the prevalence of a particular characteristic
across different settings or geographical locations (to compare the
literacy levels of 13-year olds in England, France and the USA, for
example).

Social science procedures are the appropriate procedures to use when
measuring the degree of correlation, in a particular population, between
two or more aspects of performance (such as the correlation between
behaviour problems and below average progress in learning to read, for
example) and when measuring the degree of correlation between system
variables (such as family income) and outcome variables (such as level
of achievement in reading, for example).

The group-statistical procedures of the social scientist are also the
most appropriate procedures for policy and programme evaluations. They
are well suited to providing answers to questions about the average
effect on the performance of learners and/or teachers of changes in
policy, changes in resources, changes in teaching materials, changes in
teaching procedures, and such like, at the school, district, or national
level. It would be appropriate to use a social science methodology to
evaluate the impact of a new remedial reading programme for 7-year olds
by measuring the relative rates of progress in reading of stratified
random samples of reading delayed 7-year olds who had, and had not, been
assigned to the new remedial programme, for example.

There are also many kinds of questions which *cannot* be addressed using
the group-statistical procedures of the social scientist.

The social science methodology cannot be used to study learning. This is
because learning occurs in individuals, because learning involves a
change (over time) in motivation, behaviour, understanding, skill level,
feelings, or belief, and because the research methods of the social
scientist were not designed to observe and record transition states in
individuals.

Because the group-statistical methods of the social scientist cannot be
used to study learning, they cannot be used to answer questions about
the conditions upon which motivation, learning, understanding and
retention depend, they cannot be used to answer diagnostic questions
about why particular individuals respond in the way that they do to
particular social or instructional cues, and they cannot be used to
answer questions about whether a particular motivational, teaching, or
practice procedure is working and, if not, why it is not working for
particular learners.

Nor are social science research procedures appropriate for measuring the
effects of particular teaching practices, teaching materials or
therapeutic interventions on the performance, understanding or beliefs
of individual learners. This is because, in a between-groups comparison,
the effects of treatment variables and the effects of learning history
variables are always confounded.

In spite of 100 years of effort, the social science methodology has been
found to be a less than satisfactory procedure for generating useful
theories of learning, motivation, or remembering. This is partly because
the constructs of cognitive science tend to be defined structurally and
operationally (rather than functionally), partly because cognitive
scientists spend the bulk of their time engaged in premature theorising
(rather than in observing changes in motivation, competence and recall)
and partly because social and cognitive scientists ignore the
individuals in which these changes are occurring.
