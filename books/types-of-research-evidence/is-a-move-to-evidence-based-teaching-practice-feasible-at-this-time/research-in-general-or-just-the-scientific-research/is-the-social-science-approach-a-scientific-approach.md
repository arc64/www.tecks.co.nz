Researchers who use the social science methodology routinely refer to
themselves as social *scientists*, as cognitive *scientists,* and so on.
Almost every social science methods text book starts with a chapter
about the nature of science and scientific inquiry. For more than half a
century, the social science methodology has been marketed to students of
psychology and education as a scientific endeavour. But is it?

One of the primary aims of a science is to discover order in the
variability of the science's subject matter. In the field of learning
and teaching this is individual variability in rate of learning and in
responsiveness to teaching. However, this variability cannot be studied
or understood using a methodology in which individual variability is
treated as the product of chance or as random error. Mendel took the
variability in peas as something to be explained and the science of
genetics was the end result. Galton, however, took variability in human
characteristics for granted and what has come to be known as social
"science" was the result (Johnston & Pennypacker, 1993, p. 39).

One of the characteristics of a natural science is that it has a
procedure for classifying the main elements of its subject matter.
Cognitive scientists have yet to develop an agreed taxonomy for
classifying the different kinds of changes customarily included under
the heading of learning and they have yet to develop any kind of common
procedure for classifying the different kinds of experiences which might
be considered to be necessary for learning. Cognitive scientists
continually invent new constructs without reference to their
experimental utility and continue to use old constructs even although
they have never been demonstrated to be lawfully related to anything.
There is no sign of the emergence of a common terminology which can be
used to describe various kinds of learning outcomes, various kinds of
teaching events, or the important features of educational environments.

All of the natural sciences initially restricted their attention to the
study of observable phenomena. Cognitive scientists, however, include,
within their subject matter, numerous mentalisms and dispositions, that
is, hypothetical constructs which are in practice unobservable.

One of the characteristics of a developing science is the development of
standard and absolute measures of change which can be directly compared
from one investigation to the next. However, cognitive scientists have
yet to develop standard and absolute measures of behaviour, performance,
skill level, behaviour change or automaticity. The great majority of
their measures are vaganotic measures in which the size of the
measurement unit depends upon the measurement variability observed
during the course of a particular study. Without standard and absolute
measures of change, "the discovery and communication of lawful relations
becomes virtually impossible" (Johnston and Pennypacker, 1993, p. 38).

Although they have developed procedures for doing so, cognitive
scientists do not routinely assess the reliability of the measurement
procedures used in individual investigations and do not routinely assess
and report the accuracy of the data which they have collected. Nor are
measurement accuracy and reliability data required by journal editors as
a condition of acceptance for publication.

Whereas the aim of a science is to discover reproducible relationships
(by undertaking numerous experiments using reproducible procedures) the
cognitive scientist typically undertakes a single experiment and asks us
to believe, on the basis of a statistical test, that these results will
be reproducible. Individual experiments are almost never replicated, and
cognitive science journals do not require replication as a condition of
publication, so the reliability of experimental effects remains unknown
in the great majority of cases.

The decision to study the performance of groups means that measures of
behaviour change (learning) are always contaminated by the effects of
prior learning history. This means that variables which have a lesser
effect than the effects of differences in prior learning history cannot
be studied using this method. "I should like to argue that the
statistical assumptions on which our research practice is so firmly
founded are often demonstrably false, and consequently that they
misguide much of our efforts to find patterns of behavior, particularly
of the behavior of individuals" (Thorngate, 1986, p. 73).

Most importantly of all, the application of the between-groups
methodology to the search for conditions which are necessary for
learning has identified few consistent and reproducible relationships
between experiential variables and rate of learning which are applicable
at the level of the individual learner and social science and cognitive
science research has stimulated few technological developments in
teaching practice. "Between groups designs and inferential statistics .
. . are inherently inappropriate for the task of learning about behavior
in any fundamental or analytical sense . . . and their dominance in
psychology lies at the root of psychology\'s continuing failure to build
an importantly useful science and technology" (Johnston & Pennypacker,
1993b, p. 190-191).

The widespread use of metaphorical constructs, the lack of consensus
regarding definitions, the continual generation of theories which cannot
be tested, experimental irrelevance, and the failure to arrive at any
kind of theoretical consensus have led a number of observers (e.g.
Bauer, 1992; Gellner, 1984; Johnston & Pennypacker, 1993; Machado,
Lourenço & Silva, 2000) to conclude that cognitive science is not, in
fact, a scientific activity at all.
