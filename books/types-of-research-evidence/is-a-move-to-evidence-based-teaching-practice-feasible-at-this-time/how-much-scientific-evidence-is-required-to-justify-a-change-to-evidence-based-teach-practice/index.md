# How much scientific evidence is required to justify a change to evidence-based teach practice?

Some generalisations about the conditions necessary for learning, or the
effects of a given teaching practice on learning have no research
support, some are supported by the results of a single investigation and
some are supported by the results of many investigations by different
teams of researchers. This raises the question of many times a research
finding result needs to be replicated before it is admitted to the
research base for teaching practice.
