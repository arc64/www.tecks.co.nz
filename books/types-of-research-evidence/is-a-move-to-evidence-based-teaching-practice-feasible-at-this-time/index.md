It is increasingly being argued that "teaching should be based on
research" (e.g. Darling-Hammond & Bransford, 2005; Kameenui, Carnine,
Dixon, Simmons & Coyne, 2002). However, education researchers sometimes
ask cause and effect questions and sometimes do not, sometimes use an
appropriate research method to examine questions about learning and
teaching and sometimes do not, and sometimes collect believable data
about the effects of teaching on learning and sometimes do not. This
variability in the research methods which are being used to study
learning and teaching gives rise to all sorts of methodological debates
and all sorts of questions about whether a move to evidence-based
teaching practice is feasible at this time. In this chapter we examine
some of these questions from the point of view of what has, and has not,
been achieved to date.

In Section 1 we examine the questions about the extent to which
education researchers are selecting appropriate research methods --
appropriate in the sense that they could conceivably answer the question
which is being asked.

In Section 2 we ask whether the move to evidence based practice should
be based on the entire corpus of research into learning and teaching or
just the scientific research and identify some of the characteristics
which research would need to meet before it could be said to support a
move to evidence based practice.

In Section 3 we discuss the question of how much research evidence would
be needed to justify a move from a particular craft-based practice to an
evidence-based version of that practice.

Section 4 addresses the question of whether our discoveries to date are
sufficient to justify a move to evidence-based teaching practice in
certain areas.

Section 5 asks what progress, if any, has been made in developing an
empirical theory of the conditions necessary in order for various kinds
of learning to occur.
