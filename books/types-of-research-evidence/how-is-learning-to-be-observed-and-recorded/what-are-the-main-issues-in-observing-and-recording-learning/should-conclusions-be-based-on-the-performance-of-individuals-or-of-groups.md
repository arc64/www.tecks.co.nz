# Should conclusions be based on the performance of individuals or of groups?

Often the observations of the educational researcher are observations of
the performance of individuals in a particular setting or of individuals
operating under particular conditions (such as a test). The data which
results from these observations may be reported on a case by case basis
or it may be aggregated and reported as an average (e.g. an average
score) for each group. The practice of reporting data on a case by case
basis is also referred to as the *idiographic approach* and that of
aggregating data across individuals as the *nomothetic approach*.

One of the issues which has yet to be resolved by educational
researchers is the question of when it is appropriate to report data on
a case by case basis and when it is appropriate to report only the mean
scores of groups of subjects. (In fact, the practice of calculating and
reporting mean scores is so common in educational and psychological
research that some research students have difficulty envisaging any
other kind of research data.)

While nomothetic data (such as mean scores) provide appropriate measures
of population characteristics (such as the reading achievement of New
Zealand 6-year olds), teaching (like medical practice, legal practice,
and raising children) involves providing assistance to individuals and
nomothetic data can tell us nothing about the learning of individuals.
Furthermore, any generalisations or theories which are developed with
respect to learning and teaching will need to be applicable at the level
of the individual learner otherwise they will be of no practical use to
teachers. This cannot be achieved with a nomothetic approach to
measurement.
