# What, exactly, is observed by the three main approaches to research?

The history of science tells us that scientific developments begin to
occur when we begin to make the transition from religious, philosophical
and theoretical discussion to systematic and direct observation of the
events which go to make up the subject matter of interest. This suggests
that advances in our understanding of the conditions necessary for
learning are most likely to occur when we begin to observe learning
directly and systematically. This raises two questions. What kinds of
learning and teaching events can, in fact, be observed given current
levels of technological development in observational techniques? And
secondly, what is likely to be the most scientifically productive way of
observing learning and teaching events?
