In order to study the conditions necessary for learning, or the effects
of teaching on learning, the very first problem to be solved is the
problem of how to observe learning and how to measure the rate at which
learning is occurring. Solving this problem requires the student of
learning to make important decisions about what is to be observed, how
it is to be observed, and the level of accuracy which will be aimed for.

The sections which follow address a number of interrelated questions.

In Section 1 we observe that different people have different views
regarding the nature of learning and what can be accomplished by
observation and that this affects what they select for observation.

In Section 2 we address the question of whether the constructs of
behaviour analysts, cognitive scientists and ethnographers can actually
be observed in practice.

Section 3 identifies five important issues which have complicated
attempts to develop accurate measures of rate of learning and suggest
how each of these issues might most appropriately be resolved.

Section 4 compares and contrasts the types of observation and recording
procedures used by behaviour analysts, cognitive researchers and
ethnographers.

Section 5 identifies and defines three important characteristics of
sound measures of learning: accuracy, reliability and validity and
describes ways in which each may be assessed.

In Section 6 we evaluate the believability of the data commonly
collected by behaviour analysts, cognitive scientists and ethnographers.
