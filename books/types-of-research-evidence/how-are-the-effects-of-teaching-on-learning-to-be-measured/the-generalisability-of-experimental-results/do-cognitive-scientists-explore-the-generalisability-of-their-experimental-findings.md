The types of generalisations which are of primary interest to the
cognitive scientist are generalisations regarding causal relationships
(sometimes referred to as functional relationships) at the population
level. Cognitive scientists are relatively uninterested in the
performance of individuals or in the performance of non-representative
groups of individuals. The identification of general laws
(generalisations) is to be achieved by testing hypotheses using samples
of subjects drawn from defined populations of learners.

Social science generalisations are always generalisations from a sample
to a population. "Statistical inferences have two characteristics. One,
the inferences are usually made *from samples to populations*. When we
say that the variables A and B are related because the statistical
evidence is *r* = .67, we are inferring that because *r* = .67 in *this*
sample it is *r* = .67, or near .67 in the population from which the
sample was drawn" (Kerlinger, 1964, p. 150). It is not possible to argue
from a sample correlation or a sample mean backwards to the individual
case. This is because an average score is an abstraction; it is a
measure of the performance of the group *as a group*. It can never be
argued that because a particular intervention had a given effect on the
mean performance of a group that it will have exactly the same effect on
any individual learners to whom it is applied.

The fact that generalisability is primarily a function of replication
has been recognised by some social science researchers (e.g. Nunnally,
1960; Meehl, 1997). There must be many replications of each experimental
test both by different observers working under the same conditions and
by different observers each working under slightly different conditions.
"The most important property of an empirical finding is . . .
replicability, that other investigators, relying on the description of
what was done, will (almost always) make the same (or closely similar)
observations" (Meehl, 1997, p. 423).

But this is not the way that social and cognitive scientists work. Each
published study is a new study. Individual studies are hardly ever
replicated. In fact, "the publication of \'significant\' results tends
to stop further investigation" (Bakan, 1967, p. 10). This is because
social science experiments with highly significant results appear to be
definitive. The end result of the social science approach to the study
of learning and teaching has been a "catalogue of inadequately
replicated techniques (the components of which have not been analyzed),
each of which worked at least once for the investigator who published
it" (Johnston & Pennypacker, 1993, p. 179). While this corpus of
research "may hold the appearance of an interwoven and established
literature, . . . it will prove to be a disappointing facade that does
not live up to its seeming utility" (Johnston & Pennypacker, 1993, p.
179).
