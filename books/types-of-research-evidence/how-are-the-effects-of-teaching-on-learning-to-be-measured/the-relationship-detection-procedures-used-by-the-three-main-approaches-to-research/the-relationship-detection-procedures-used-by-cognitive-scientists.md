In their search for relationships, researchers who employ a social
science methodology make use of a variety of research designs. The 1997
*International Handbook of Educational Research, Methodology and
Measurement* (Keeves, 1997) contains chapters on cross-sectional
methods, experimental methods, longitudinal methods, simulation methods,
effective schools research, correlational methods,
quasi-experimentation, hierarchical linear modelling, log linear models,
path analysis, regression analysis, and so on. Borg and Gall (1989)
describe the following types of research methods: correlational methods,
prediction studies, multiple regression methods, discriminant analysis,
path analysis, structural equation modelling, quasi-experimental studies
and true experiments. Under the heading of experimental studies, they
describe the pretest-posttest control group design, the posttest-only
design, the single factor multiple-treatment design, two factor and
three factor designs, aptitude treatment interaction designs, the
Solomon four group design, and the counterbalanced design.

When cognitive scientists undertake experiments, these are almost always
between-groups experiments where the effect of the experimental
treatment is measured by comparing the average post-treatment retention
or achievement of experimental subjects against that of control group
subjects.

When cognitive scientists study effects, they study the effects of two
main kinds of variables: treatment variables and attribute variables.
Treatment variables are sometimes referred to as active variables
because they can be actively manipulated. "Treatment variables are those
factors that the experimenter manipulates and to which he or she assigns
subjects" (Best & Kahn, 1993, p. 137). Attribute variables are also
referred to as organismic variables or as assigned variables. "Attribute
variables are those characteristics that cannot be altered by the
experimenter. Such independent variables as age, sex, race, and
intelligence level have already been determined, but the experimenter
can decide to include them or remove them as variables to be studied"
(Best & Kahn, 1993, p. 137). The use of attribute variables as
independent variables is another key difference between cognitive
science and behaviour analysis. For the cognitive scientist and the
social scientist, variability in a measure of performance (such as level
of motivation) can function as either a dependent variable (the variable
to be explained) or as an independent variable (a possible explanation).
For the behaviour analyst variability in a measure of performance can
only function as a dependent variable (the phenomenon to be explained).
