# Descriptive questions and relational questions

The aim of research is to find the answer to questions for which the
answer is not yet known. Such questions may take a variety of forms.
Consider, for example, the following questions:

1."What are primary teachers\' views as to how writing should be taught
in the classroom?"

2."How do teachers actually teach writing in the classroom?"

3."Do more experienced teachers provide more help with corrections
during writing periods than less experienced teachers?"

4."What is the effect, on the amount which a child writes, of helping a
child to correct his or her writing errors?"

Questions 1 and 2 are questions about the current state of affairs. In
order to answer the first question, we would need to talk to teachers,
ask them about their views and then *describe* these views. In order to
answer the second question, we would need to observe teachers at work
and then *describe* the kinds of things which teachers do during writing
lessons.

We could ask similar questions about any kind of teaching or learning
activity: co-operative learning techniques, whole language approaches to
reading, accelerated learning techniques, adapting teaching to
students\' learning styles, and so on. Questions 1 and 2 may be referred
to as *descriptive questions* because they imply a descriptive research
strategy. In order to answer them, the investigator must observe what is
happening, or talk to people about what is happening, so that this can
be described.

Questions 3 and 4 are questions about *relationships*. Questions 3 asks
"Does the amount of help with corrections which teachers give co-vary
with the teacher\'s experience?" In other words, is there a correlation
(a relationship) between the experience of teachers and the amount of
help which they provide with corrections? Questions 4 asks "Does the
amount which a child writes from day to day co-vary with the amount of
help which the child receives in correcting his or her writing errors?"

To answer the second two questions, we must observe and measure *two*
factors in each case. To answer Question 3 we must find out, for each
teacher, (a) how much teaching experience they have had and (b) how much
help with corrections they give. Then we need to calculate the
*correlation* between the two measures. To answer Question 4 we would
need to find out, for each child, (a) how much help with corrections
they are receiving and (b) how much they are writing. We would then need
to calculate the correlation between these two measures. Alternatively,
we could conduct an experiment in which we varied the amount of help
provided, and observed the amount written, in an attempt to determine
whether different amounts of help result in different amounts being
written.

Questions 3 and 4 may be described as *relational questions* because
they imply a research strategy which will identify relationships between
variables, that is, relationships between recurring events. The two main
research procedures which are used to identify relationships are the
correlational procedures and the experimental procedures.
