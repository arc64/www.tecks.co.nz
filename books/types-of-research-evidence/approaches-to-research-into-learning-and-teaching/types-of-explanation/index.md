Why engage in research on learning? Presumably one of the major aims of
such research is to identify the conditions on which learning depends
or, more accurately, to identify the sets of conditions on which
different kinds of learning depend. The pursuit of this aim requires a
clear understanding regarding those events which are likely to be
affecting learning and a clear understanding of the kinds of behaviour
change (learning) which are likely to be affected by such events. One of
the measures of success with respect to this endeavour will be the
development of explanatory theory.

Explanation normally involves pointing to a cause. The concept of cause
is built into the language. Every use of the word "because" implies a
causal statement, explanation, or reason for the action preceding the
"because". Causal explanation is prized because it enables prediction.
Prediction is also built into the language. The future tense is the
prediction tense. Most causal statements (e.g., "practice enhances
retention") can be turned into predictions (e.g., "If practice is
required, then this skill will be remembered". "If . . . then"
statements of this kind are useful because they can be used as a guide
for action. In other words, developments in explanatory theory result in
improvements in our ability to predict when particular kinds of learning
are and are not likely to occur. They may also result in improvements in
our ability to control learning, that is, improvements in our ability to
help people to learn.

The search for explanations is a search for understanding, and the kind
of understanding which is most useful is the understanding which can be
used as a guide for future action. However, researchers bring to the
research task different beliefs regarding what counts as an adequate
explanation. These beliefs influence what is looked for and, hence, what
is found as a result.
