The history of science teaches us that the concepts and distinctions
which are embedded in everyday language and which we use in everyday
life are never sufficient to describe the results of scientific study of
natural phenomena.

Thus the Newtonian revolution was the result of realizing that common
sense notions about change, forces, motion and the nature of space
needed to be replaced if we were to uncover the real laws of motion. We
had to give up our common sense suppositions that there is a preferred
direction in space, that the earth is at rest, that if something is
moving there must be a force acting on it. Instead we must view motion
at constant velocity as the absence of net forces, consider "down" as
just the direction toward the strongest source of gravity, and accept
that the Earth is moving at about 700 feet per second (Rosenberg, 1995,
p. 15.)

What we learn from the history of science is that one of the early
outcomes of scientific investigation is the development of a technical
vocabulary which can be used to make the new distinctions which
systematic observations suggest will need to be made in order for the
science to progress.
