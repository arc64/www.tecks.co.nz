Research into teaching is a relatively recent activity. The earliest
reports of teaching research date from the beginning of the 20th
century. The earliest educational researchers believed that educational
research would involve the application of scientific methods of
investigation to educational phenomena such as learning and teaching and
the term research is still used in this sense in some textbooks on
educational research methods. "Research may be defined as the systematic
and objective analysis and recording of controlled observations that may
lead to the development of generalizations, principles, or theories,
resulting in prediction and possibly ultimate control of events" (Best &
Kahn, 1993, p. 20). The key words in Best and Kahn's definition are
"resulting in prediction". It is an enhanced ability to make predictions
which is the hallmark of the results of scientific research in the
traditional sense of "scientific".

During the course of the 20th century, however, the meaning of the
phrase "education research" has gradually expanded to the point where
educators now use the word "research" to cover many different kinds of
investigative activity. "Although the term originally referred to
activities related to the acquisition of basic knowledge in the
sciences, humanities, and arts, its contemporary usage permits it to be
applied to the acquisition of any form of information however trivial
that information may be" (Travers, 1978, p. 3). Reber\'s *Dictionary of
Psychology* for example, defines research as "Any honest attempt to
study a problem systematically or to add to knowledge of a problem"
(Reber, 1995, p. 665). McMillan and Schumacher (1989, p. 8) define
research as "a systematic process of collecting and analyzing
information (data) for some purpose" while Shulman defines research to
include any form of "disciplined inquiry". "When we speak of research,
we speak of a family of methods which share the characteristics of
*disciplined inquiry*. . . . What is important about disciplined inquiry
is that its data, arguments, and reasoning be capable of withstanding
careful scrutiny by another member of the scientific community"
(Shulman, 1988, p. 4-5).

Because the definition of educational research has expanded to include
almost any kind of inquiry, this creates a dilemma. It means that we
will not be able to answer the question "What is to count as evidence?"
simply by referring to an agreed definition of research. Instead we will
have to examine the various kinds of investigative activities engaged in
by educational researchers and identify those types of investigation
which are most likely to generate the kinds of evidence which could,
conceivably lead to improvements in our understanding of learning and
teaching processes.

Sometimes it is suggested that what is to count as evidence might be
decided by compiling findings from investigations which have used
reliable research procedures. Any attempt to list educational research
procedures, however, generates a very long list. The 1997 *International
Handbook of Educational Research, Methodology and Measurement* (Keeves,
1997b) contains chapters on cross-sectional methods, experimental
methods, longitudinal methods, simulation methods, effective schools
research, correlational methods, quasi-experimentation, hierarchical
linear modelling, log linear models, path analysis, regression analysis,
and so on.

One common way of organising research methods textbooks and handbooks is
in terms of descriptive research procedures, correlational research
procedures, and experimental research procedures. The descriptive
procedures include questionnaires, structured interviews, focus group
interviews, rating scales, achievement testing, direct observation, time
sampling, taking running records, ethnography, and so on. The
correlational procedures include regression and multiple regression,
discriminant analysis, path analysis, hierarchical linear modelling,
quasi experimentation, and so on. Experimental procedures include all
the single-subject experimental procedures (alternating conditions
designs, reversal designs, multiple baseline designs, changing criterion
designs, and so on) and all the between groups experimental procedures.
Under the heading of experimental studies, Borg and Gall (1989) describe
the pretest-posttest control group design, the post-test-only design,
the single factor multiple-treatment design, two factor and three factor
designs, aptitude treatment interaction designs, the Solomon four group
design, and the counterbalanced design.

The problem with trying to distinguish between reliable and unreliable
findings on the basis of the investigative method used is that a
particular investigative method can be applied appropriately or
inappropriately and it can be applied carefully or carelessly. So this
procedure will not work either.

The solution which we have developed in this account is first to group
the research methods which might be used to study learning and teaching
under one of three general approaches to research and then to take into
account both the approach which has been used and the adequacy of the
way in which that approach has been applied in the particular
investigation under examination. The three general approaches to
research which we will consider are (a) the natural science approach
(and in particular behaviour analysis research), (b) the social science
approach (and in particular cognitive science research) and (c) the
ethnographic approach (and in particular interpretive research). (For an
example of a research methods text organised along these lines, see, for
example, Martella, Nelson and Marchand-Martella, 1999.)
