For behaviour analysts, the subject matter is *variability in the
behaviour of individuals.* Behaviour analysts argue that the behaviour
of individuals is an important subject matter because each individual
must acquire the behaviours, skills, and emotional reactions necessary
for survival during their lifetime and that there is value in coming to
understand how this occurs. "This approach. . . is based on the
conviction that behavior is an appropriate subject matter for
investigation, not as an epiphenomenon, but in its own right. . . . The
interest in learning about how certain environmental variables may
influence the response class lies in the belief that behavior is largely
the result of environmental variables" (Johnston & Pennypacker, 1993b,
p. 11).

The behaviour analyst defines *behaviour* as actions, engaged in by an
individual, which involve an interaction with the environment, and which
result in a detectable change in that environment. This definition
excludes such events as the "behaviour of the stock market" (because the
stock market is not an individual), such events as the "behaviour of a
group" (because groups are not individuals), and such events as "not
calling out," "receiving a reward," or "getting wet" (because these
involve no action). The definition also excludes all states such as
"being hungry" or "being anxious" and all traits such as "positive
attitude", "intelligence", or "self-efficacy", because these are not
references to the learner\'s interaction with his or her environment.

The subject matter of behaviour analysis includes both verbal behaviour
(e.g., conversing, answering questions, writing essays) and non-verbal
behaviour (e.g., cooking a meal, driving a car, playing chess). Like the
subject matter of qualitative research and the subject matter of
cognitive science, the subject matter of behaviour analysis includes
both public behaviours such as conversing (which can be observed by more
than one person) and private behaviours such as thinking (which can be
observed by only one person). Behaviour analysts are "keenly interested
in all human behaviour - both the publicly detectable and the private
kind" (Heward & Cooper, 1992, p. 349). In other words, the movement
which defines a particular behaviour may occur inside the skin or
outside the skin. Breathing and thinking are behaviours even although
they are occurring inside the skin. Behaviour analysts "consider private
events such as thinking or sensing the stimuli produced by a damaged
tooth to be no different from public events such as oral reading or
sensing the sounds produced by a musical instrument" (Cooper, Heron &
Heward, 1987, p. 11).

The environment, likewise, may be inside the skin or outside the skin.
Going to the toilet in response to a full bladder, and scratching an
itch are examples of behaviours where the stimulus which is being
responded to is inside the skin.

The skin is simply an arbitrary structural boundary. . . . Behavior
analysts, contrary to most reports, do not discount the role of internal
events in their analyses. Rather, they consider them to be physical and
potentially observable events that, like external physical events, can
affect behavior. . . . Rather than making inferences about cognitive and
mental events, behavior analysts assume that internal events are real
events that possess structure and, more importantly, can affect behavior
and, thus, enter into functional relations with behavior (Schlinger,
1995, p. 36-37).

The subject matter of behaviour analysis is the behaviour of
*individuals*. "The person . . . is conceived of as a unique individual,
a conception that is worked into behavior analytic research strategies
and consequently into its scientific assertions. Persons in this system
are indivisible wholes, active in and interactive with their
environments, changing and changed by the context and the consequences
of their behavior" (Chiesa, 1994, p. 201). Behaviour analysts draw a
careful distinction between data which describe the behaviour of
individuals and data derived from the statistical aggregation of the
performances of groups of individuals. They argue that the data from
single subject analyses and the data from statistical analyses are two
completely different subject matters and that, because the two types of
data are incomparable, the researcher must make an explicit choice to
study either one subject matter or the other (e.g., Sidman, 1960;
Johnston & Pennypacker, 1993b).

Behaviour analysts consider time to be an essential element of the
subject matter under investigation. "Behavior must be viewed as a
continuous process that occurs through time" (Cooper, Heron & Heward,
1987, p. 18). Not only are actions engaged in repeatedly, particular
instances of a given action exhibit variability from one performance to
the next. Even a simple action such as eating varies from one occasion
to the next with respect to what is eaten, where the eating occurs, how
quickly the eating is engaged in and so on. It is this variability which
is of primary interest to the behaviour analyst. (This interest stands
in marked contrast to the cognitive science approach where behavioural
variability is treated as measurement error.) "All scientists share the
responsibility of investigating the variability that their measurement
of natural phenomena reveals. In the science of behavior, it is our task
to measure and explain variability in behavior" (Johnston & Pennypacker,
1993a, p. 178).

Behaviour analysts draw a clear distinction between structural and
functional approaches to their subject matter. To date, behaviour
analysts have been most interested in questions of function (e.g., What
are the variables which led to the development of this behaviour?) than
in questions of structure (e.g., How do children solve this kind of
problem?). "If we are interested in how and why behavior occurs, then we
need to concentrate on its function(s)" (Schlinger, 1995, p. 18).
However this is changing as behaviour analysts come to realise that a
complete account will require the analysis of both the structure and
functions of behaviour. "The orientation from which this book is written
deals with both function and structure" (Catania, 1998, p. 6). "In a
comprehensive account of behavior, both form and function are important"
(Schlinger, 1995, p. 18).

Behaviour analysts acknowledge that a change in behaviour is likely to
be accompanied by changes in the brain and/or nervous system of the
individual. The behaviour analyst does not claim "that learning has no
physiological basis. Of course it does, and it would be fascinating to
know what neurological changes accompany learning" (Catania, 1998, p.
2). The behaviour analyst simply works on the assumption that changes in
behaviour can be studied *in their own right*. "Do we ever look at an
organism\'s brain to decide whether it has learned something?" (Catania,
1998, p. 2). We do not. Teachers constantly make judgements about
whether or not a child has learned a new skill, they make these
judgements on the basis of what they see the child doing, and they do
not reserve judgement until they have examined the child's brain to see
whether it, too, has changed. Behaviour analysts operate in a similar
fashion.

Of all the research methodologies employed by educational researchers,
the subject matter of behaviour analysis is most closely similar to the
subject matter which is of interest to teachers, teacher educators, and
teaching researchers. Unlike the cognitive scientist, the behaviour
analyst studies learning in individuals (each with their own unique
learning history). Unlike the interpretive researcher and the cognitive
scientist, the behaviour analyst studies *changes* in the abilities,
understandings, motivation, beliefs and feelings of individuals over
time. Time is part of the subject matter. Unlike the subject matters of
the interpretive researcher and the cognitive scientist, the subject
matter of behaviour analysis includes the detailed analysis of those
variables which are of greatest interest to teachers, that is, the
external conditions upon which learning depends.

A common criticism of behaviour analysis is that the subject matter of
behaviour analysis is limited to the study of physical actions or
limited to the study of relatively trivial aspects of human development
(e.g., Brophy, 1983). While there are many aspects of human learning
which have yet to be studied by behaviour analysts the same can also be
said of the learning research undertaken by interpretive researchers and
cognitive scientists.

In fact, the range of interests within behaviour analysis is already
quite wide. Behaviour analysts are studying the development of most
kinds of academic skills including reading (e.g., Carnine & Silbert,
1979; Gersten, Keating, & Becker, 1988), reading comprehension (e.g.,
Bigler, 1984; Bruce & Chan, 1991), handwriting (e.g., Stowitschek,
Ghezzi, & Safely, 1987), spelling (e.g., Dixon, 1993; Okyere, Heron, &
Goddard, 1997), compositional writing (e.g., Hopman & Glynn, 1988),
maths (e.g., Blankenship & Baumgartner, 1982; Paine, Carnine, White, &
Walters, 1982), science (e.g., Lazarus, 1991), and so on. Behaviour
analysts are studying the development of language (e.g., Sidman, 1994;
Hart & Risley, 1995) and the conditions necessary for the development of
conceptual and other kinds of understanding (e.g., Engelmann & Carnine,
1991; Muthukrishna, Carnine, Grossen, & Miller, 1993). Behaviour
analysts have studied the learning and teaching of various kinds of
self-care skills (e.g., Smeets, Lancioni, Ball, & Oliva, 1985; Yeaton &
Bailey, 1983) and various kinds of motor skills (e.g., Koop, & Martin,
1983; Ward, Crouch, & Patrick, 1998). Behaviour analysts are studying
the development of motivation, attitudes, interests, and persistence.
They are examining the development of self-control (e.g., Brown & Frank,
1990; Watson & Tharp, 2002), and creativity (e.g., Winston & Baker,
1985). Behaviour analysts are studying the origins and treatment of a
variety of learning disorders including speech disorders (e.g.,
Goldiamond, 1966), behaviour disorders (e.g., Patterson, 1982),
toileting disorders (e.g., Foxx & Azrin, 1973), eating disorders,
depression, and the anxiety disorders (e.g., Barlow, 1988). Behaviour
analysts are studying the effects on learning of a very wide range of
teaching variables including different types of prompting (scaffolding),
the timing of prompts, the selection and sequencing of teaching
examples, opportunity to respond, the scheduling of practice, the type
and frequency of assessment, types of error correction, feedback
variables, types and schedules of reinforcement and differential
reinforcement, automaticity building, mastery criteria, and so on (e.g.,
Carnine, 1989; Gardner et al., 1994; Swanson, O\'Shaughnessy, McMahon,
Hoskyn & Sachse-Lee, 1998; Van Houton, 1984; Wolery, Ault & Doyle,
1992).

Behaviour analysts have even tackled the very difficult question of how
it is that words and other symbols come to acquire meaning for the
individual. See for example, DeGrandpre (2000), Sidman (1994), Skinner
(1957), and Staats (1968). Most of these accounts attempt to show how
the operation of two-, three- and four-term contingencies could function
to "give meaning" to both elements of the language (such as words) and
to elements of the environment (such as objects).
