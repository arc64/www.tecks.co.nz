Most learning requires a certain amount of practice. This practice may
be of various kinds. Practice may be child initiated or teacher
initiated, practice responses may be overt (visible) or covert
(invisible), practice may involve constructed responses or selection
responses, practice responses may vary with respect to effort (size),
practice opportunities may vary with respect to how closely they
simulate test conditions or real life conditions, and practice may
involved untimed responding or timed responding.
