# Effects of untimed versus timed practice

It is only possible to learn to execute particular responses more
quickly if practice is timed. In other words, practice which is designed
to build fluency must always be timed practice. Unless practice is timed
neither the teacher nor the student will be able to determine whether
practice responses are faster than was previously the case, that is,
essential performance feedback (regarding improvement in speed) will be
absent. As far as we can determine, however, this assumption appears
never to have been tested experimentally --Â presumably because it is
self-evident.
