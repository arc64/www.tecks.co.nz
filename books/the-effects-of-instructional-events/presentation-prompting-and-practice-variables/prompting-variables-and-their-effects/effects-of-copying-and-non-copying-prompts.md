# Effects of copying and non-copying prompts

It is possible for a prompt to be presented and then removed from view
prior to responding (a non-copying prompt) or for the prompt to stay in
view while the learner responds (a copying prompt). Examples of copying
prompts are spelling words which stay in view while the learner copies
the word, permanent models of mathematical operations which stay in view
while the learner performs the operation, and so on.

It is usually argued that behaviour prompts should always be removed
prior to responding so that the learner has to attend to the practice
stimulus while responding rather than simply attending to the prompt.

Early research into this question involved programmed sequences of
instruction in which older secondary or tertiary level students were
required to write short responses to complete single proposition
"frames" presented in a linear sequence. In a series of experiments in
which students were either allowed to copy or prevented from copying the
answers from feedback frames, it was found that the students who were
required to construct an answer prior to viewing the feedback frame
tended to recall more on average than the students who were allowed to
copy responses from the feedback frame (Anderson, Kulhavy & Andre, 1971,
1972).

However, this may not be the case with respect to all learning outcomes.
It is clear that, when young children are learning to spell, they are
often unable to retain the complete spelling of a new word in working
memory if the model of the correct word is removed prior to the practice
response (McWilliams, 2005). In this case leaving the prompt in view can
result in more rapid acquisition than is the case when non-copying
prompts are used (Van Daal, & Van der Leij, 1992).
