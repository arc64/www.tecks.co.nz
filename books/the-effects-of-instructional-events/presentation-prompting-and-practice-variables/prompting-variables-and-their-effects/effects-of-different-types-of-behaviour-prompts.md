The research into behaviour prompting is extensive. Controlled studies
of behaviour prompting procedures have demonstrated that the
introduction of models of correct responding greatly increases the rate
of acquisition of new pronunciation responses (Camarata, 1993; Mann &
Baer, 1971), animal names (Tekin & Kircaali-Iftar, 2002), vocabulary
words (Lahey, 1971), reading responses, (Heron, Heward, Cooke, & Hill,
1983), spelling responses (McWilliams, 2005; Telecsan, Slaton, &
Stevens, 1999), procedures (Werts, Caldwell, & Wolery, 1996),
mathematical operations (Rivera & Smith, 1988; Smith & Lovitt, 1975),
various self-care skills (e.g. Haring, Breen, Weiner, Kennedy, &
Bednersh, 1995), and various kinds of social skills (e.g. Simpson,
Langone, & Ayres, 2004).

Behaviour prompts in the form of models of correct performance have been
shown to accelerate acquisition not only when delivered by teachers but
also when delivered by videotape (Haring et al., 1995; Simpson, et al.,
2004), by trained peers (Heron et al., 1983; Telecsan, 1999; Werts et
al., 1996), and by computers (McWilliams, 2005).

Other studies have demonstrated accelerated acquisition following the
introduction of instruction prompts during the learning of a variety of
different kinds of procedures including everyday tasks (McAdam & Cuvo,
1994; Mechling & Gast, 1997; Mitchell, Schuster, Collins, & Gassaway,
2000; Trask-Tyler, Grossi, & Heward. 1994), and mathematical operations
(Noell, Gresham, & Gansle, 2002).

Instruction prompts have been delivered not only by teachers but also as
written instructions (Nietupski, Clancy & Christiansen, 1984), tape
recorded instructions (Trask-Tyler et al., 1994), and computer presented
instructions (Noell et al., 2002). It is also possible to teach even
quite young children to recite the sequence of steps to be performed and
for the child to then self-prompt their way through a new procedure
(Vintere, Hemmes, Brown & Poulson, 2004).

The research on prompting includes research into the use of various
kinds of technology to deliver prompts in an accurate and timely fashion
in busy environments. For example Shabani, Katz, Wilder, Beauchamp,
Taylor and Fischer (2002) explored the use of a remote pager to prompt
social initiation responses in children with autism and there are a
number of studies in which parents have acquired new responses to child
misbehaviour as a result of instruction prompts delivered via a radio
microphone to a bug-in-the-ear receiver (Forehand, Sturgis, McMahon,
Aguar, Green, Wells et al., 1979; Forehand, Wells & Griest, 1980).

In many studies the teacher has combined instructions and modelling or
combined instructions with a permanent model during the teaching of new
skills. The combined show and tell procedure has several advantages. A
demonstration usually provides a better indication than a verbal
description of *how* to perform each of the component responses. At the
same time, the verbal instructions can be used to direct the learner\'s
attention to critical features of the performance, to review the order
in which the steps should be performed, and to explain why certain steps
have to be taken. Generally speaking research confirms that this type of
prompting procedure can result in the very rapid acquisition of new
procedures and operations (e.g. Rivera & Smith, 1987).

There have been few attempts to compare the relative effectiveness of
different types of behaviour prompts. Schunk (1981) in an experiment
which was more concerned with questions regarding self-efficacy found
that demonstrations of how to complete division operations were slightly
more effective than written descriptions of the procedure with 8 to 11
year olds. Vintere et al. (2004) report that once the sequence of
instructions had been memorised, self-instruction was slightly more
efficient than teacher modelling in teaching dance step sequences to 4
year olds.

There are, of course, practical limitations to the type of behaviour
prompts which can be used with different learners. For example, the
effectiveness of a verbal instruction depends upon the learner\'s
ability (and motivation) to follow the instruction. Verbal instructions
cannot be used to prompt the performance of new behaviours in pre-verbal
learners, or in learners who have not yet learned to comply with the
instructions of other people, or with learners who do not understand the
instruction.
