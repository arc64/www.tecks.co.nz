# Presentation, prompting and practice variables

The antecedent variables which provide opportunities for learners to
work with new content and to practice new responses can vary in many
ways. In this chapter we summarise experimental research which has
analysed the effects of variations in the mode and content of teacher
presentations, variations in procedures for prompting new responses and
skills, and variations in the type of practice, amount of practice and
scheduling of practice opportunities.
