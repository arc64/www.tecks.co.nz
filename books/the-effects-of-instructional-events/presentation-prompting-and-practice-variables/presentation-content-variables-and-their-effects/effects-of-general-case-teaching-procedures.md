Analyses of the concept learning task by a number of authors (e.g.
Becker & Carnine, 1980; Church, 1999; Engelmann & Carnine, 1991) suggest
that, in order to teach generalised correct responding to the members of
a stimulus class, the learner must have the opportunity to work with
both examples and non-examples of the concept.

Critical to teaching the difference between examples and non-examples of
a new concept is the sequencing of examples and non-examples during
instruction. Research suggests that the most efficient procedure for
doing this is the procedure known as *general case programming.* A
detailed account of general case programming will be found in Engelmann
and Carnine (1991). With general case programming examples are sequenced
so that adjacent positive examples are maximally different*.* This is
the most efficient procedure for teaching the student the outer
boundaries of the stimulus class (Carnine, 1980a). With general case
programming example/non-example pairs are sequenced so that minimally
different example/non-example pairs occur together. Minimally different
example/non-example pairs result in faster learning of the
discrimination between examples and non-examples than
example/non-example pairs which are more obviously different (Carnine,
1980b). With general case programming examples and non-examples are
sequenced in such a way that only one feature changes from one example
(or non-example) to the next. In a third experiment, students who were
taught concepts with simultaneously presented minimally different
positive and negative examples reached criterion in about half as many
trials as students who were presented with the same examples, but
successively and with multiple differences between adjacent examples
(Carnine, 1980b).

A number of separate experiments have demonstrated that both normal and
learning disabled students acquire new concepts more rapidly when these
rules are followed (e.g. Becker & Carnine, 1980; Carnine, 1980a;
Carnine, 1980b; Engelmann & Carnine, 1991; Granzin & Carnine, 1977;
Kelly, Gersten & Carnine, 1990; Williams & Carnine, 1981).
