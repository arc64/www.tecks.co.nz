Given that a certain amount of practice will be required in order to
achieve a given learning outcome, the next question to be addressed is
the question of how practice sessions should be scheduled in the days
and weeks following initial teaching.

The first observation which we can make in this regard is that it is the
first few minutes of any given practice session which result in the
greatest improvement. Early research (involving relatively meaningless
tasks) showed that, as a practice session progresses, the amount of
improvement which occurs gradually declines until little or no
improvement is occurring. This is consistent with practical experience.
If practice sessions are too long people get fatigued or bored and
performance drops away.

The implication of this observation is that practice sessions should be
kept relatively short. \"Short\" is usually interpreted to mean a
practice session of 5 to 10 minutes in duration (or less for very young
children). Mayhall and Jenkins (1977) found that 10 minutes practice per
day of 80 sight words and 100 single digit addition facts resulted in
more rapid improvements in speed and accuracy than a 20 minute practice
session every two days.

The suggestion that practice periods should be kept relatively short
seems to contradict the practice commonly adopted by students of lengthy
\"cramming\" periods immediately prior to tests and exams. However, this
apparent contradiction disappears when it is realised that the aims of
the two activities are quite different. The aim of \"cramming\" is to
remember certain material for a very short period of time, typically one
or two days. The fact that most of the \"crammed\" material will be
forgotten almost immediately is of no concern to the student. The aim of
practice in the early years, on the other hand, is to develop skills and
understandings which will be remembered for many months - perhaps
remembered for a lifetime - and this is a rather different learning
goal.

Given that the most effective practice sessions are relatively short (5
to 10 minutes) in duration, the next question to be addressed is how
they should be scheduled in time. The research is relatively clear on
this question. *Practice sessions should be spaced*. There should be a
substantial \"rest\" period between each practice session. A one-day
interval between practice sessions is the most commonly used \"rest\"
period. When two (spaced) practice sessions are held a day apart,
students learn much more (sometimes twice as much) than they do when
those same practice sessions are held one after the other (massed).

The finding that practice sessions should be distributed in time
(spaced) has a large amount of research support. After reviewing the
research into the scheduling of practice sessions, Frank Dempster
concluded that "This phenomenon - known as the 'spacing effect' - is one
of the most robust and dependable phenomena yet documented by
psychologists. The spacing effect also is remarkable in the scope of its
application: with students of all ages and ability levels, in all sorts
of situations, and with a wide variety of materials and procedures.
Spacing effects have been found in a variety of instructional modes,
including learning from text, lecture presentations, and computer
assisted instruction. Subject matter has included historical facts,
arithmetical rules, addition facts, science concepts and vocabulary"
(Dempster, 1991, p. 72).

The spacing effect has never been satisfactorily explained. Possibly it
is related in some way to the fact that the brain continues to change as
a result of new experiences for up to 12 hours following the experience
(Rose, 1993). With knowledge learning tasks, on the other hand, if the
interval between practice sessions is more than 2 days, then there is a
good chance that previously learned material will be forgotten again
(Nuthall & Alton-Lee, 1993).
