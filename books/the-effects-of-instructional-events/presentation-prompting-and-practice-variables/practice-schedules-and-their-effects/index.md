# Practice schedules and their effects

Practice occurs across time. Practice opportunities can be scheduled
across time in many different ways. The way in which individual practice
responses are distributed in time can vary. The way in which practice
sessions are distributed in time can vary. The number of different
responses or skills which are to be practiced in a particular practice
session and the number of practice opportunities provided for each of
these different responses in a practice session can vary. The ratio of
practice responses which involve yet to be acquired, partially acquired
and previously acquired responses can vary.

Early studies of practice schedules were largely limited to comparing
the relative benefits of "massed practice" against various types of
"spaced practice". More detailed studies of what children remember
suggest that a much more fine grained analysis of the relationship
between practice responses and their distribution in time will be
necessary in order to identify optimal schedules of practice for
different kinds of learning outcomes.
