# Effects of negative social reactions

The most commonly used consequence of inappropriate behaviour during
childhood is adult disapproval. The suppressive effects of disapproval
are acquired. (A reprimand has no effect on the behaviour of a baby.)
The social punishers include such events as the negative reactions of
others, insults, jokes at our expense, the unwanted demands of others,
criticism, reprimands, negative feedback, being treated like a younger
person, and any other reaction from others makes us feel foolish,
embarrassed, intimidated, anxious, or fearful.

Social punishers, like all learned punishers are culturally relative. A
particular phrase which functions as an insult or a reprimand in one
society or culture may have no meaning and hence no punishing affect in
another culture. Whether or not a particular event (such as a warning)
will function as a learned punisher also depends upon the age and
learning history of the individual child.

Commonsense descriptions of how to use reprimands suggest that
reprimands have a stronger suppressive effect if the person delivering
the reprimand stands relatively close to the child (within a metre or
so), if they maintain eye contact while delivering the reprimand and if
the reprimand refers to the specific behaviour which has been judged to
be inappropriate (Van Houten & Doleys, 1983).

Training studies with the teachers and parents of misbehaving children
strongly suggest that at least some misbehaviour is a function of the
amount of attention which it receives from the parent (or teacher). For
example when parents are trained to distinguish between appropriate and
inappropriate behaviour, and to respond more accurately to appropriate
and inappropriate behaviour with approval and disapproval, quite rapid
improvements in child behaviour are usually observed (e.g. Moore &
Bailey, 1973).

Because studies of the effects of socially mediated consequences have
tended to be studies of the effects of approval and disapproval
together, little is known about the effects of disapproval on its own.

Several studies have shown that when teachers consistently disapprove of
off-task behaviour or inappropriate behaviour in 4- to 8-year old
children, the effect is to reduce the amount of inappropriate behaviour
engaged in (Morris & Redd, 1975; Pfifner, O'Leary, Rosen & Sanderson,
1985).

Teachers who use a mixture of approving and disapproving reactions (or
disapproving reactions only) tend to maintain higher levels of on-task
behaviour in their children than teachers who use only approving
reactions (Morris & Redd, 1975). The same effect has been observed for
parental management of misbehaviour and antisocial behaviour in the home
(Rolider & Van Houten, 1984). The praise-reprimand tactic has also been
shown to be slightly more effective than the praise only tactic at the
junior high school level (Workman, Kindall & Williams, 1980).

While positive social reactions to appropriate behaviour alone are not
sufficient to motivate adequate levels of on-task behaviour or response
accuracy in 6- to 8-year old children with behaviour problems, they may
do so after a period in which teachers respond to both appropriate and
inappropriate behaviour with approval and disapproval (Pfifner &
O'Leary, 1987).

When the teacher reprimanded the off-task behaviour of four hyperactive
6 and 7-year olds this had the effect of partially suppressing
interactive off-task behaviour but not non-interactive off-task
behaviour (Abramowitz & O'Leary, 1990).

The dilemma is that teachers who use only positive reactions to child
behaviour are better liked by children than teachers who use a mixture
of approving and disapproving reactions to on-task and off-task
behaviour -- at least during the early years (Morris & Redd, 1975). It
is probably this factor which accounts for the strong preference by many
early childhood and early primary school teachers simply to ignore the
misbehaviour and off-task behaviour of younger children even although
this is a much less effective behaviour management tactic than
responding appropriately to both desired behaviour and misbehaviour.
