# Effects of naturally occurring aversive consequences

There are many situations where a given behaviour has a consequence and
that consequence is an aversive consequence which motivates the learner
to avoid that behaviour in particular situations in the future. Examples
include risky responses, careless responses, absent minded responses and
other types of responses which result in trips, falls, bruises, burns,
sprains, broken bones and other kinds of injuries. There has been little
in the way of controlled research into they way in which children learn
not to engage in behaviours which result in naturally occurring aversive
consequences. However, the great majority of children learn to avoid the
risky behaviours which adults have learned to avoid and it seems safe to
assume that much of this learning occurs as a result of experiencing the
aversive consequences which are often the natural result of careless
actions.
