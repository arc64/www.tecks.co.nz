# Effects of negative feedback

Incorrect responses and inappropriate responses can generate feedback
from the physical or social environment. When an incorrect or
unsuccessful response generates feedback this feedback is variously
referred to as \"error feedback\", \"negative feedback\" or "corrective
feedback". There is clear evidence that error feedback functions as an
aversive event (a punisher) for most children and from an early age.
This is indicated by the fact that most children work to avoid mistakes
in their school work and the teacher corrections which result when one
makes a mistake (McWilliams, 2005). For such children, error corrections
are aversive consequences (because the child tries hard to avoid them)
and the delivery of corrections meets the scientific definition of a
punishment contingency for these children (because incorrect responses
are suppressed).

There are two common types of teacher (and parent) responses to
incorrect (or unsatisfactory) responses. The first is that the errors
are simply ignored, that is, neither accepted as correct, nor corrected.
This procedure is very frequently used by teachers. If a student
responds with an incomplete or less than satisfactory answer, the
teacher simply calls upon another pupil to respond to the original
question. The second possibility is that errors result in some kind
consequence. The most commonly observed consequences are: (a) somebody
provides some kind of error feedback (e.g. "No, that's not right."), (b)
somebody provides error feedback and some kind of correction (e.g. tells
the learner the correct response), or (c) somebody provides error
feedback, and a prompt, and another opportunity to respond.

Which of these two types of differential reinforcement (ignoring or
correction) are most effective? Reviews of research into this question
are agreed that errors, if they occur, must not go uncorrected.
Following a review of several of his own experiments, Douglas Carnine
concluded: "When the teacher corrected errors \[during arithmetic
lessons\], the children said the right answer about 70 per cent of the
time during training and 65 per cent of the time during post-test. When
the teacher ignored errors, the child said the right answer about 15 per
cent of the time during training and 15 per cent during post-test
(Carnine, 1977, p. 177).

In a review of the research into the effects of feedback,
Bangert-Drowns, Kulik, Kulik and Morgan (1991) reached essentially the
same conclusion. "Feedback\'s primary importance is in correcting
errors. In these studies, the probability that an item on the dependent
measure would be answered correctly when the same item was answered
correctly during instruction was very high regardless of the presence or
absence of feedback. However, when an item was answered incorrectly
during instruction, it was much more likely to be answered correctly (on
the post-test) in the feedback condition than in the no-feedback
condition" (Bangert-Drowns et al., 1991, p. 232).

The way in which error corrections accelerate the acquisition of new
responses has been demonstrated for a variety of skills: pronunciation
(Radgowski, Douglas, Allen & LeBlanc, 1978), swimming strokes (Koop &
Martin, 1983), spelling (McNeish, Heron & Okyere, 1992; Vargas,
Grskovic, Belfiore & Halbert-Ayala, 1997), compositional writing (Kline,
Schumaker & Deshler, 1991; Stone & Serwatka, 1982) and maths (Carnine,
1977).

Some parents, early childhood educators, and teachers believe that it is
better simply to ignore children\'s errors during practice than it is to
correct them. Research into the effects of error corrections clearly
provides no empirical support for this view as far as the learning of
new skills is concerned.
