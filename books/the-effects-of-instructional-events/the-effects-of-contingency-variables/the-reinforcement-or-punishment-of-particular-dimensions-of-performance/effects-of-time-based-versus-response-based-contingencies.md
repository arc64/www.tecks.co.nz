There are a number of situations where teachers have a choice between
response-based and time-based contingencies.

**DRL versus punishment**

For example, a teacher or parent can reinforce a child for not engaging
in antisocial behaviour for a given time period (say one hour) or can
apply a punishment or penalty each time that the child engages in
particular antisocial behaviours. When Trice and Parker (1983) compared
the effect of reinforcing two 16-year old boys for not swearing against
the effect of a response cost penalty for each instance of swearing they
found that both procedures were equally effective in suppressing
swearing.

**Reinforcing time on task versus productivity**

When a teacher is attempting to motivate task engagement he or she may
elect to reinforce criterion levels of time on task or to reinforce
criterion levels of productivity. When Lannie and Martens (2004)
compared the effect of reinforcing students for time on task against the
effect of reinforcing students for the number of exercises completed on
maths worksheets they found that the students preferred to earn
reinforcement for being on task when the worksheets contained difficult
exercises but to earn reinforcement for the number completed when the
worksheets contained easy exercises.
