# Positive and negative reinforcement and punishment contingencies

The practice responses (and other behaviours) engaged in by learners can
have no consequence for the learner or they can have a consequence.
Practice responses can produce desired events or they can work to avoid
undesirable consequences. Practice responses can result in undesirable
consequences or they can result in the disappearance of a desirable
state of affairs. Each of these contingencies, that is, each of these
response-consequence relationships, have different effects on the
likelihood that the learner will engage in a particular response or
behaviour again in the future.
