# Effects of two term versus three term learning interactions

Practice interactions may take the form of a response to a practice
stimulus (a two-term learning interaction) or a response to a practice
stimulus which is followed in turn by a consequence of some kind (a
three-term interaction). Because consequences function to determine
which behaviours will be remembered and used again in the future it is
hardly surprising to find that students who are studying under
conditions in which the majority of learning interactions are three term
interactions acquire new skills and understandings more rapidly than is
the case with students who are studying under conditions where many
learning interactions are two-term interactions (Albers & Greer, 1991).
