# Schedules of reinforcement and punishment

A particular response may be successful in generating reinforcement or
in avoiding punishment every time that it is used or it may be
successful on only some occasions. A teacher or parent may correct or
punish a particular behaviour every time that it occurs or they may
detect and correct the behaviour only on some occasions. The number or
proportion of occasions when a particular response has a reinforcing (or
punishing) outcome is referred to as the schedule of reinforcement (or
punishment). Schedules of reinforcement and punishment may vary in a
number of ways. For example, consequences may be scheduled to occur
frequently or infrequently, to occur continuously or intermittently and
to occur predictably or unpredictably.
