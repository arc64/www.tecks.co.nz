# Effects of predictable versus unpredictable schedules of consequences

As stated in the previous section, intermittent schedules of
reinforcement tend to produce responses which are more resistant to
extinction. Intermittent schedules, however, may be predictable (as when
answers are marked after, say, every 10th response) or they may be
unpredictable (as when answers are checked from time to time). As might
be expected, it is the unpredictable intermittent schedules which
produce the highest levels of persistence. The clearest demonstration of
this effect is in the behaviour of the habitual gambler but it has also
been demonstrated in the classroom (McLaughlin & Malaby 1976; Saudergas,
Madsen, & Scott, 1977; Theodore, Bray, Kehle & Jensen, 2001).
