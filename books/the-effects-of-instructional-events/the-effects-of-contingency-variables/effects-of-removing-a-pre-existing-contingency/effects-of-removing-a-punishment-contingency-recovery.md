# Effects of removing a punishment contingency (recovery)

*Recovery* refers to operations where a punishment contingency which
previously operated ceases to operate and the learner begins once again
to engage in the behaviour which had been suppressed by the punishment
contingency. The recovery effect has been observed following the removal
of both positive punishment contingencies and negative punishment
contingencies.

When a punishment contingency ceases to operate in the classroom, the
recovery effect is sometimes observed (e.g., Ramp, Ulrich & Dulaney,
1971) and sometimes not observed (e.g., Luce, Delquadri & Hall, 1980).
This raises the question of when a punishment contingency is likely to
lead to permanent suppression and when it is likely to result in only
temporary suppression of the punished response.

At the present time, it is not possible to answer this question by
examining the research on punishment. This is because there is so little
research into punishment in classroom settings.

It seems reasonable to hypothesise that the recovery effect (temporary
suppression) is most likely to occur in cases where an alternative
appropriate response (which the learner can use to avoid punishment) is
not acquired while the punishment contingency is operating and in cases
where the inappropriate behaviour continues to generate reinforcement
for the person using it both while the punishment contingency is
operating and following its withdrawal.
