Research into the effects of various kinds of consequences and
contingency operations on motivation and learning is extensive. The
effects of reinforcing pupils for their effort, their productivity, and
their correct responses have been studied in many hundreds of controlled
experiments. As a result we know more about the effects of consequences
than we do about the effects of almost any other teaching variable.
Lysakowski and Walberg reviewed some of this research in 1981 and
concluded that reinforcement variables have a stronger effect on
learning than almost any other variable apart from practice itself. They
further concluded that: \"Contrary to previous theory and opinions, the
strong effects of instructional reinforcement appear constant across
grades (kindergarten through college), socio-economic levels, race,
private and public schools, and community types\" (Lysakowski & Walberg,
1981, p. 69).

Since then researchers have continued to study the effects of different
types of reinforcing (and aversive) consequences, the effects of
different types of contingencies, the effects of different schedules of
reinforcement (and punishment) and the effects of reinforcing different
dimensions of performance.

In this chapter we will review the effects on motivation and learning of
introducing and removing positive and negative reinforcement
contingencies, the effects of introducing and removing positive and
negative punishment contingencies, the effects of differentially
reinforcing differing dimensions of performance and the effects of
differing schedules of reinforcement and punishment.
