Positive feedback is the information which signals that a practice
response is correct or appropriate or that a task has been performed in
a satisfactory manner. Much of the positive feedback which occurs in
classrooms tends to go largely unnoticed by teachers (although not by
students). The feedback which is provided by others during the course of
social interactions is often quite subtle. If a child says something
which the teacher judges to be incorrect during a classroom discussion
the child will often not be told that the answer is unsatisfactory.
Rather the teacher will elaborate the question or ask another child what
she thinks. Most children very quickly learn that, when the teacher
repeats what they have said and asks a new question, these events signal
that the contribution was accepted by the teacher whereas \"question
redirected to another pupil\" or "question elaborated" are feedback
events which indicate that the previous answer was less than
satisfactory.

The approving reactions of others often include a positive feedback
component. But feedback can also be provided independently of the
reactions of others. Responses to exercises and classroom activities can
be marked as correct or incorrect without, necessarily, praising the
correct responses.

Commonsense accounts of feedback tend to argue that feedback is most
effective when students themselves are involved in the evaluation of
performance, when even small improvements generate feedback, and when
the feedback is informative and precise (Van Houten, 1984).

It is widely believed that feedback events which inform the learner that
their performance was correct, or satisfactory, or improved, are events
which function as reinforcing consequences, that is, as events which
result in increased retention and motivation to continue practising and
improving, and there is some evidence to suggest that this may be the
case (Hillman, 1970; Manos, 1983; McLaughlin, 1992). However, the
research into feedback tends to be research which is not well controlled
and which, as a result, suggests very little in the way of definitive
conclusions. The main problem with the feedback research is that it
simply fails to control the variables which need to be controlled if the
effects of different kinds of feedback contingencies are to be
identified. There are four main classes of events which have been left
uncontrolled in almost all of the research into the effects of feedback.

1.First, feedback may follow correct responses, or incorrect responses,
or both. In most experimental studies of feedback, feedback information
has been provided following both correct and incorrect responses. While
these experiments provide some information about the effects of feedback
in general, they provide no information regarding the effects of
*positive* feedback, that is, feedback following *correct responses*.

2.When feedback is provided following correct and incorrect responses,
it is to be expected that its effects on both learning and motivation
will depend upon the ratio of correct to incorrect responses provided by
each learner. For example, error corrections might be much more
important if the error rate is high than if the error rate is low.
However, difficulty level and error rate are hardly ever controlled in
the feedback research and, in the great majority of cases, the error
rates of individual learners are not even reported.

3.Classroom studies of feedback almost invariably fail to separate out
the effects of the feedback and the effects of the positive and negative
teacher reactions in which the feedback is embedded -- making it
impossible to determine the effects of the feedback component and the
social reinforcement component (e.g., Kastelen, Nickel & McLaughlin,
1984; Luiselli & Downing, 1980).

4.It seems highly unlikely that positive feedback could have an effect
on learning or remembering in those situations where the learner is
able, by whatever means, to determine whether or not their response is
correct without feedback. It is almost certainly this factor which
accounts for the fact that, when new responses are well prompted, the
addition of feedback may have no additive effect on rate of learning
(McWilliams, 2005; Messer, Mohamedali & Fletcher, 1996; Messer, Norgate,
Joiner, Littleton & Light, 1996). However, there are few, if any,
feedback experiments which have been limited to learning tasks where all
of the learners are unable to determine (by themselves) which of their
responses are correct and which are not.

Provided it is recognised than we cannot as yet identify the relative
contributions of positive feedback and error feedback to feedback's
effects on learning and motivation, the results of the research into the
effects of feedback during classroom tasks may be summarised as follows.

The provision of performance feedback regarding classroom behaviour can
result in improvements in time on task and reduced levels of
inappropriate behaviour (Greenwood, Hops, Delquadri & Guild, 1974; Maggs
& Morgan, 1986; Scriven & Glynn, 1983).

The provision of feedback following student responses on worksheets and
other kinds of written exercises usually results in an increase in the
proportion of correct responses on such exercises (Conlon, Hall &
Hanley, 1972; Hillman, 1970; Luiselli & Downing, 1980; Maags & Morgan,
1986; McLaughlin, 1992; Robinson, DePascale & Roberts, 1989).

The provision of feedback during oral reading can result in an increase
in the accuracy level and the fluency level of that reading (Eckert,
Ardoin, Daley & Martens, 2002; Thorpe, Chiang & Darch, 1981) and the
provision of feedback regarding the content of children's writing can
result in an improvement in both the amount written and the quality of
the writing (Jerram, Glynn, & Tuck, 1988; Scriven & Glynn, 1983).

The provision of performance feedback following 1 minute maths sprints
(time trials) has been shown to result in an increase in number of
correct responses per minute (Miller, Hall, & Heward, 1995; Rhymer,
Dittmer, Skinner & Jackson, 2000).

These effects have been observed for oral feedback and written feedback
delivered not only by teachers but also by peers (Conlon et al, 1972),
and by computers (McWilliams, 2005; Messer, Mahamedali et al., 1996;
Robinson et al., 1989).

Generally speaking, children who are working on acquisition tasks and
who receive feedback following each response show greater improvement
than children who receive feedback following a block of practice
responses and children who receive feedback following a block of
responses show greater improvement than children who receive feedback
some time later (such as the following day) (Hillman, 1970).
