Much reinforcement arises naturally as a result of successful
performance. Successful meal preparation results in a reinforcing meal.
Successful navigation gets us to a reinforcing social event, on time, on
the other side of town. A successful library search finds the report, or
the novel, which we were looking for.

Whether or not a particular learning activity will generate any natural
reinforcement depends upon the level of difficulty or challenge posed by
the current learning activity. It is widely recognised that tasks which
lack any kind of challenge (tasks which are too easy) are experienced as
unmotivating, boring, or even aversive, that is, they are tasks which
generate little or no reinforcement.

If bored students are moved from activities which are too easy onto
tasks which pose some challenge, then task engagement, work output, and
attitude often improve (Umbriet, Lane & Dejud, 2004). Clifford (1990, p.
22) explains the positive attitude which results from success on
challenging tasks in the following terms "We attribute the success we
experience on easy tasks to task ease; we attribute the success we
experience on extremely difficult tasks to luck. Neither type of success
does much to enhance self-image. It is only success at moderately
difficult or truly challenging tasks what we explain in terms of
personal effort . . . and these explanations give rise to feelings of
pride, competence, determination, satisfaction, persistence and personal
control."

A second kind of behaviour which produces its own reinforcement is
completion of a task at which we have become competent. Successful
performance in a competition results in a win -- which motivates
continued competition. Successful test performance results in a passing
mark --Â which may motivate continued study. Competent reading results in
the sensory stimulation of an interesting story -- which motivates
further reading, and so on. Learning researchers have yet to figure out
whether the motivating effects of successful performance are due to
"intrinsic reinforcement", whether they are due to the reinforcing
effects of the feedback which signals a job well done, or whether they
are due to some other, as yet unrecognised, cause.
