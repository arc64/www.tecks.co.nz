# Positive reinforcement contingencies and their effects

The effects of positive reinforcement contingencies have been more
extensively studied than the effects of any other type of contingency.
As a consequence a wide variety of events have been found to have
reinforcing properties. In this section we will group these reinforcing
events under five headings: biological reinforcers, natural reinforcers,
preferred activity reinforcers (Premack's Rule), social reinforcers and
positive feedback. The study of reinforcement has also involved a study
of the effects of reinforcing a variety of different dimensions of
performance: perseverance, productivity, responding correctly, fluency,
and so on, across a range of different tasks such as attending,
complying, handwriting, reading, writing, maths, athletic skills, social
skills, and so on. The great majority of this experimental work has been
replicated across both younger and older children, both with and without
special teaching needs.
