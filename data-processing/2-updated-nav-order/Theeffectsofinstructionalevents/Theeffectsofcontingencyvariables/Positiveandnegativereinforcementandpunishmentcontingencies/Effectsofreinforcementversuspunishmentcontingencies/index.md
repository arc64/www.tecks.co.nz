Most people can distinguish between the use of rewards (which often
function as reinforcers) and punishments. However, it is important to
remember that one cannot classify a consequence as reinforcing or
aversive simply by looking at the consequence. This is because
consequences are classified by their effects -- so classification
requires observation of the response, its consequence, and the effects
of the consequence on response frequency (motivation).

In an experiment by Thomas, Becker and Armstrong (1968), an increase in
teacher reprimands resulted in an increase in student misbehaviour and a
decrease in reprimands produced a reduction in misbehaviour - showing
that teacher reprimands (and the accompanying teacher attention) were
function as a reinforcing consequence for these students. This was quite
the opposite of what the teacher intended and highlights how important
it is that all teachers learn to distinguish between reinforcing and
aversive consequences.

Another reason why it is not possible to classify consequences as
reinforcing or aversive simply by looking at the consequence is because
the same consequence can have different effects on different learners.
While most younger children find praise reinforcing, there are some
children for whom praise is a neutral consequence -- a consequence which
has no effect on their motivation or their learning (e.g., Weissenburger
& Loney, 1977). While most children find teacher attention reinforcing,
there are some children who find teacher attention aversive and who will
work to avoid teacher attention. While most children find being sent
from the room aversive and will work to avoid being sent from the room,
there are some children for whom being sent from the room is reinforcing
because it allows them to escape from having to work on tasks which are
too hard for them.
