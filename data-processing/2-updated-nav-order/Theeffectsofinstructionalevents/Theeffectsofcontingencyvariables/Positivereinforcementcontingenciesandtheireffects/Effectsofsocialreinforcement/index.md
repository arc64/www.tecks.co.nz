The reinforcing consequence which is most commonly used by teachers and
parents is the positive social reaction which we refer to as praise or
approval. Common sense accounts of praise usually argue that praise
should be descriptive and refer to the particular behaviour which is
being praised, should take a variety of different forms, should appear
to be sincere and spontaneous, should include feedback regarding the
quality of the performance, should attribute success to effort (rather
than to ability or luck), and should be used in a way which does not
interfere with on-going learning activities (Gage & Berliner, 1988).

Because praise and other types of positive reactions from other people
*acquire* reinforcing properties as a result of experience, they have
different effects on the behaviour and motivation of children with
different learning histories (e.g., O'Leary, Becker, Evans & Saudergas,
1969). For example, the effects of praise are *culturally relative*. A
particular phrase which functions as a commendation and hence as a
reinforcer in one culture may have no meaning and hence no reinforcing
properties outside that culture. In Western cultures it is considered
appropriate to praise younger children for responding correctly. In many
Asian cultures it is considered inappropriate to praise children simply
for responding correctly because this may make them \"conceited\". In
addition, the effects of a social reaction such as praise tend to vary
with the age of the learner. Praise has no effect on the behaviour of a
baby. For many adolescents, praise from a parent or teacher is far from
reinforcing (and in some contexts may be quite aversive). Thirdly, the
effects of praise and other forms of positive attention depend upon the
child rearing experiences of the learner. A child who is being raised in
an environment where adults are behaving in a highly punitive manner or
in a highly inconsistent manner may be unaffected by praise because it
has no meaning for them (Church, 2003).

While there have been many studies of praise and its effects on a range
of learning outcomes, many of these studies have combined praise and
feedback or praise and rewards with the result that the effects of the
praise (on its own) cannot be determined. However, a number of
experimental analyses which have controlled these confounding variables
can be found and these experiments suggest a number of conclusions.

First, reminders about rules and praise for following classroom rules
results in greater improvements in classroom behaviour than reminders
about rules on their own (Everett, Olmi, Edwards & Tingstrom, 2005;
Greenwood, Hops, Delquadri & Guild, 1974).

Secondly, praise tends to be a relatively weak reinforcer. Most other
types of reinforcement (contingent rewards, contingent access to
preferred activities, and so on) tend to result in higher levels of
motivation and more rapid improvements in time-on task, productivity,
and correct responding than contingent positive attention from the
teacher alone (Glynn, 1972; O'Leary et al., 1969) and this is especially
true for children with behaviour problems.

Thirdly, there have been a number of studies of what happens when
teachers attempt to shape improvements in performance by watching out
for improvements and praising these when they occur. For example
teachers have used positive attention to improvements to produce
increased compliance in pre-school children (Goetz, Holmberg & LeBlanc,
1975) and in Grade 1 children (Schutte & Hopkins, 1970), to produce
increased response diversity (creativity) in pre-school children (Fallon
& Goetz, 1975), and to produce increased levels of concentration and
work completion in normally developing primary school children (Yawkey,
1971), in children with behaviour problems (Sutherland, Wehby &
Copeland, 2000) and in children with learning disabilities (Maag,
Rutherford & DiGangi, 1992). Differential attention has also be used to
shape reduced levels of disruptive behaviour in junior secondary school
classrooms (Workman, Kindall & Williams, 1980).

Fourthly, more rapid improvements in task completion and more rapid
reductions in disruptive behaviour occur with differential attention
(that is, when the teacher approves appropriate behaviour and shows
disapproval for inappropriate behaviour) than when the teacher simply
gives positive attention for appropriate behaviour -- especially at the
secondary level (McAllister, Stachowiak, Baer, & Conderman, 1969;
Workman et al., 1980).

Given that positive teacher attention plays an important role in
strengthening the student behaviour which the teacher attends to, it is
disappointing to discover that the majority of classroom teachers, even
in the early grades, respond relatively infrequently with positive
remarks about improvements in student performance (Rossiter, 1982;
Thomas, Presland, Grant & Glynn, 1978; White, 1975; Wyatt & Hawkins,
1987). White (1975) observed a sample of 100 U.S. teachers. The Grade 1
teachers reacted positively to student behaviour at a rate of .66
approvals per minute, the Grade 3 teachers reacted at the rate of .38
approvals per minute, and the Grade 4 teachers at the rate of .32
approvals per minute. Wyatt and Hawkins (1987) observed 35 U.S.
teachers. The Grade 1 teachers used positive reactions at a rate of .58
per minute. The data from New Zealand classrooms is closely similar.
Rossiter (1982) observed a sample of 11 New Zealand junior school
teachers and found approval rates of .62 per minute. Thomas et al.
(1978) reported that the mean approval rate for a sample of 10 Year 6
teachers was 0.2 approvals per minute.

Faced with these findings, teacher educators sometimes argue that
teacher trainees need to learn to be "more positive" or to use "praise
more often". However, training teachers to increase the frequency of
their positive reactions to students has proved to be difficult both in
the preservice settting (Rose, 1994) and in the inservice setting
(Rossiter, 1982).

An alternative approach is to teach the children who are being ignored
to recruit teacher attention. Teaching students to recruit teacher
attention is based on the assumption that "a potentially effective
natural contingency of reinforcement is 'asleep' and needs to be 'woken
up' (Alber & Heward, 2000, p. 177). To date there have been ten
controlled evaluations of this procedure. These evaluations have been
reviewed by Alber and Heward who conclude that "Students who are taught
to recruit receive more praise and instructional assistance from
teachers. Recruiting attention for targeted academic or work tasks can
increase the productivity and accuracy with which a student performs
those tasks" (Alber & Heward, 2000, p 193). A wide range of students
have been trained to recruit teacher attention: at-risk preschoolers
(Stokes, Fowler & Baer, 1978), normally developing primary school
children (Hrydowy, Stokes & Martin, 1984), primary students with
learning disabilities (Alber, Heward & Hippler, 1999), primary students
with behaviour problems (Morgan, Young & Goldstein, 1983) and primary
students with intellectual disabilities (Craft, Alber & Heward, 1988).
