Once a distinction has been made between antecedents and consequences,
it becomes possible to distinguish between two general types of learning
interactions: three-term interactions, and two-term interactions.

-   A *three-term* *learning interaction* is one which contains an
    antecedent stimulus, a response, and a consequence following that
    response.
-   A *two-term learning interaction* is one which contains only an
    antecedent stimulus and a practice response (but no consequence).

The distinction between two-term and three-term learning interactions is
extremely important because three-term interactions often result in more
rapid learning than is the case with two-term interactions especially
during the initial phase of learning something new.
