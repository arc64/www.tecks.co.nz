The earliest explorations of the conditions necessary for learning were
made by social scientists and cognitive scientists. These contributions
are described in most conventional educational psychology textbooks
(e.g. Gage & Berliner, 1998; Slavin, 1999) and have been summarised in
many meta-analyses and reviews of meta-analyses (e.g. Lipsey & Wilson,
1993). The work of cognitive psychologists has identified a number of
the variables which operate when students are engaged in unstructured
and semi-structured learning activities. Variables which have been found
to have reproducible effects on remembering include such things as the
age of the learner, recency, list length, amount of practice,
meaningfulness of the material to be remembered, the quality of the
explanations provided by the teacher, the provision of learning goals
and study questions, conditions which motivate self-rehearsal of the
material to be learned, corrective feedback following errors, the
teaching of certain types of study skills, and so on (Cawelti, 2004;
Lipsey & Wilson, 1993; Walberg, 1986; Walberg & Wang, 1987; Wang,
Haertel, & Walberg, 1993; Wittrock, 1986).

Following the development of repeated measures, single case procedures
and their application to the experimental analysis of teaching and
learning in the early 1970's, rapid progress has been made in
identifying instructional variables which directly affect rate of
learning -- with over 1,500 such experiments having been reported to
date. This research is beginning to reframe our view of the behaviour
changes which we refer to as learning and the relationships between
teaching variables and learning (e.g. Church, 1999b, 2004).

**Conditions necessary for different kinds of learning**

As a result of this research we have discovered that there are different
kinds of learning outcomes which teachers and teaching researchers need
to distinguish between. This is because different kinds of teaching and
practice conditions need to be provided before the learning and
remembering of different kinds of skills and understandings can occur
(Church, 1999b; Engelmann & Carnine, 1993). For example, we now know
that meanings and attitudes are acquired primarily through respondent
processes while motivation, new skills, new concepts, and so on are
acquired primarily through operant processes. We also know that
motivation requires the presence of conditions which are different to
those which are required for acquisition and that different conditions
are required during the initial, independence and fluency building
phases of acquisition processes. The implications of these distinctions
for the scientific study of learning processes will be considered in
greater detail in Book 4 of this website.

**Research on child development**

In addition, there is a very extensive research base in child
development charting the developmental trajectories which most children
follow with respect to physical development, the development of large
motor skills, language acquisition, learning to read, the acquisition of
writing skills, the development of mathematical concepts and skills,
social development, the acquisition of initial scientific
understandings, and so on (e.g., Brown, 1973; Geary, 1996; Gessell,
1940, 1956; Gessell, Ilg, Ames & Bullis, 1946; Gordon, 1986; Meggitt,
2006; Piaget, 1930).

There is also a very large research base describing the way in which
these typical developmental trajectories can be interrupted in children
with physical disabilities, intellectual disabilities, learning
disabilities, emotional and behavioural disorders, and so on (e.g.,
Church, 2003; Hallahan & Kauffman, 2005; Heward, 2005).

**The determinants of motivation**

Research on learning has identified many of the variables upon which
motivation depends. We have discovered that the consequences of student
effort are the most important variables (rather than the interest level
of instructional activities) and researchers have explored in some
detail the effects of different kinds of consequences, schedules of
consequences, and contingencies on motivation, effort, productivity, and
persistence (e.g., Catania, 1998; Cooper, Heron & Heward, 2007; Malott,
Whaley & Malott, 1993).

**Conditions necessary for the development of meaning**

We have discovered the basic process involved in the acquisition of word
meaning and have found, from research, that new meanings are acquired
almost instantaneously and sometimes without conscious effort
(DeGrandpre, 2000; Staats, 1968). This finding is quite contrary to the
view that the acquisition of new meanings requires a process of
conscious of meaning construction.

**Conditions necessary for acquisition**

Analysis of the conditions necessary in order for different kinds of
acquisition to occur is well advanced. This research includes
experimental analyses of the conditions necessary for language
development (e.g., Hart & Risley, 1995; Sidman, 1994); the conditions
necessary for the development of various kinds of motor skills (e.g.,
Ward, Crouch, & Patrick, 1998), the conditions necessary for the
development of mathematical competencies (e.g., Paine, Carnine, White, &
Walters, 1982) and the conditions necessary for the development of
literacy skills including decoding fluency (e.g., Church, Nixon,
Williams & Zintl, 2005), reading (e.g., Church & Martin, 1992;), reading
comprehension (e.g., Bruce & Chan, 1991), handwriting (e.g., Trap,
Milner-Davis, Joseph & Cooper, 1978), spelling (e.g., Okyere, Heron &
Goddard, 1997), and compositional writing (e.g., Hopman & Glynn, 1988).

**Conditions necessary for learning to read**

We have discovered the key component skills which must be mastered in
order to learn to read (e.g., Church, 2005; National Reading Panel,
2000). We have discovered that complex skills, such as reading, require
mastery of a number of component skills and that, if the component
skills are not mastered at the right time, then the child may never
master the more complex skill during their years at school.

**Identification of a useful unit of analysis**

Learning researchers have identified the basic unit of analysis which
needs to be tracked during the study of acquisition processes -- the
three term contingency (Albers & Greer, 1991; Church, 1999a) and have
made a start in seeking to discover the number of learning interactions
which are necessary during the acquisition of different types of
academic skills (e.g., McLay, 2003; McWilliams, 2005).

**Number of practice responses and their distribution in time**

We have discovered not only that learning interactions must be within
the child's zone of proximal development but also that the number of
times that a child comes into contact with a particular word, fact, or
concept is the most important determinant of whether or not that word,
fact or concept will be remembered (e.g., Church, 1976; Greenwood,
Delquadri & Hall, 1984; Hart & Risley, 1995; Nuthall, 1999, 2007).

We have discovered not only that the number of learning opportunities is
critical but also that their distribution in time is critical as well. A
new item of knowledge is only remembered if the child gets to work with
that idea on at least four occasions with no more than two days between
each learning opportunity (Nuthall, 1999). The work on response
opportunity and the distribution of practice responses in time has
profound implications for teaching research for it means that
experimental analyses of learning and teaching are only likely to
generate interpretable results if the number of learning opportunities
and their scheduling is controlled, or at least recorded, across all
experimental conditions (McWilliams, 2005).

**Conditions necessary for long term retention**

A long tradition of research into the retention process has revealed
that recall speed (also referred to as level of automaticity or level of
fluency) is the best predictor of long term retention and this has led
to the development of practical ways of measuring fluency in academic
subjects and research into the fluency criteria which predict long term
retention (e.g., Church, 1999b; Johnson & Layng, 1994).

**Identification of research procedures which work**

Most importantly we have learned, as a result of more than 1,500
experiments, how to measure motivation, learning, and the development of
mastery in individual learners and we have learned how to accurately
measure the effects of particular social and instructional conditions on
motivation, learning and the development of mastery in individual
learners (e.g. Church, 1996; Fuchs & Fuchs, 2001; Johnston &
Pennypacker, 1993).

A description of the main types of learning which need to be
distinguished and the main events which have been shown to influence
learning will be found in Book 2 of this website and a detailed account
of the scientific research into the conditions necessary in order for
these different kinds of learning to occur will be found in Book 4 of
this site.
