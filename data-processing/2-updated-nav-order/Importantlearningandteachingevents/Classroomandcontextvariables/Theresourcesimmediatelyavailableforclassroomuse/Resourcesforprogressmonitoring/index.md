The term *progress monitoring test* refers to the 1-3 minute fluency
tests which effective teachers use on a daily or twice weekly basis to
measure student progress towards defined teaching goals such as decoding
fluency, reading fluency, sight word recognition, handwriting fluency,
key boarding fluency, spelling fluency, compositional writing fluency,
fluency in specified mathematical operations, and so on. These progress
monitoring tests are most commonly referred to as probe tests, or as
*probes* for short. Some readers will recognise the practice of
measuring student progress using daily or twice-weekly fluency testing
as *curriculum based measurement*.

As far as classroom practice is concerned, the probe tests which have
the greatest impact on teaching effectiveness are those which are
immediately available from the school's resource room. The adequacy of
the materials provision for progress monitoring may be measured by
examining the school store room and counting the number of academic
skills at each year level for which sets of probe tests are immediately
available for classroom use.
