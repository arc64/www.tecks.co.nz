In order to begin to learn the letter-sound equivalence relations which
will be necessary in order to make timely progress in learning to read,
the child must first learn to discriminate (tell the difference) between
each of the printed letters. English orthography consists of 26
unaccented lower case letters and 26 upper case letters. Several of the
letters (e.g. a and g) have alternate forms (e.g. *a* and g)*.* Learning
to discriminate between the 52 letter shapes typically occurs within the
context of letter naming activities which take the form:

see the letter--\>say the name of the letter.

The ability to discriminate between the printed English language letters
is most commonly referred to as letter naming or knowledge of letter
names, or orthographic knowledge and is widely recognised as a skill
which needs to be acquired during the first year of school, if not
before.
