Some behaviours have reinforcing (or punishing) outcomes each and every
time that they are engaged in. Eating known food, for example, is a
behaviour which is reinforced every time that it occurs. A behaviour
which produces reinforcement every time that it is engaged in is said to
be on a *continuous* *schedule* of reinforcement. It is also possible to
have a continuous schedule of punishment. Touching live electrical wires
is a behaviour which generates punishment on a continuous schedule.

Other behaviours produce reinforcement only from time to time. In the
classroom, working consistently is sometimes noticed by the teacher and
praised and at other times it goes unnoticed. Behaviours which are
reinforced only some of the time are said to be on an *intermittent
schedule* of reinforcement. The intermittent schedules are also referred
to as *partial schedules* by some authors. It is also possible to have
an intermittent schedule of punishment as when a parent sometimes sends
a child to time out for defying an instruction and sometimes does not.
