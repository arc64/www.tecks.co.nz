The sequence of concept examples and non-examples used within a set of
presentations or exercises may vary in many ways. The only
example/non-example sequencing procedure which has been studied in any
detail to date is the sequencing procedure which has come to be called
the "general case procedure". A general case teaching sequence is one in
which the sequencing of examples and non-examples conforms to the
following rules.

1.The teaching sequence includes a number of positive examples of the
concept and these positive examples illustrate the full range of values
which can be found in the stimulus class.

2.The teaching sequence includes a number of non-examples of the concept
and these non-examples are closely similar to the positive examples
which have been selected - especially with respect to irrelevant
features.

3.Positive examples are sequenced so that adjacent positive examples are
maximally different.

4.Example to non-example pairs (and vice versa) are sequenced so that
minimally different example/non-example pairs occur together.

5.Examples are sequenced in such a way that only one feature changes
from one example (or non-example) to the next.

Many other kinds of sequences are possible but, to date, the general
case sequencing procedure is the only one which has generated any
research and the only one which has been given a name. As can be seen
from the above rules, general case programming involves the selection
and sequencing of teaching examples in such a way as to teach the
desired generalisation without producing any misconceptions.
