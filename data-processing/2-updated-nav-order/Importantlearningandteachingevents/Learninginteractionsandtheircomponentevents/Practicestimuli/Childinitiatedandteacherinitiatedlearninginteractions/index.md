Learning interactions may be initiated by the environment (e.g. by other
people) or they may be initiated by the learner. If mum says to the
child, "What is this letter?" and the child responds, we have an example
of a learning interaction initiated by the environment. If the child
says to mum, "What letter is this?" and mum responds, we have an example
of a learning interaction initiated by the learner.

We distinguish between child initiated and teacher initiated learning
interactions because it is widely argued that child-initiated
interactions are "better" than interactions initiated by others. The
research evidence, on the other hand suggests that even young children
learn just as quickly from adult initiated learning interactions as they
do from child initiated learning interactions (McLay, 2003). This debate
makes the distinction doubly important.
