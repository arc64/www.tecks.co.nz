Practice responses can vary in size (and effort) from writing a single
word through to writing a complete project report. The effort which is
involved in completing a practice activity is also a function of how
fluent the learner has become in performing the component responses. A
student who writes at 5 words a minute will find completing a 2-page
report a much more effortful activity than the student who is able to
write the same report at 20 words a minute.

Although most teachers can distinguish between more and less effortful
tasks, response effort has yet to be adequately defined. This is
unfortunate because practice activities which involve considerable
response effort are much less likely to be completed than practice
activities which involve the learner in less response effort. Response
effort also has a very powerful effect on student motivation.
