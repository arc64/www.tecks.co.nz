New information may be presented to the learner in various ways, that
is, in various presentation modes. The presentation modes most commonly
seen in the classroom are aural presentations, visual presentations, and
audio-visual presentations.

-   *Aural* presentations include such things as teacher talk, student
    talk, audio tapes, radio broadcasts, and so on for the learner to
    listen to.
-   *Visual* presentations include such things as written texts to read,
    maps and diagrams to look at, demonstrations to watch, and so on.
-   *Audio-visual* presentations include such things as DVDs, videos,
    films, plays, and so on to be watched and listened to.

The distinction between different presentation modes is important
because the different modes often serve different functions. For
example, until a child learns to read, new information must be presented
in the aural mode, that is, in the form of talk. Written presentations
become possible only when the learner can read with a reasonable level
of expertise. The different modes are also processed in different areas
of the brain.
