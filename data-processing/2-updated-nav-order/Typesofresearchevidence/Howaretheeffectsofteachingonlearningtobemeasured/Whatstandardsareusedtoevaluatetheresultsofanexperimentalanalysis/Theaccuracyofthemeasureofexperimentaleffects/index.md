The second question which may be asked of an experimental result is the
question "Does the data from this experiment accurately represent the
degree or rate of change (learning) which resulted from the intervention
which was implemented during the experiment?" This is analogous to
asking whether or not a measurement procedure has generated an accurate
representation of the events which were observed.

The greatest threat to the accuracy of an experimental result is poor
experimental control, that is, the inconsistent administration of
experimental and control treatments from one session to the next. But
there are other factors which can also produce an inaccurate
experimental result. One of these is the failure to run experimental
treatments for a sufficient length of time. In order to produce an
accurate measure of treatment effects, the learner must experience each
experimental treatment for a period of time sufficient to produce an
accurate measure of the rate of learning which occurs under each
treatment condition. This facet of experimental design is seldom
discussed and may be referred to as the *sensitivity* of the
experimental procedure (Church, 1996). Where two treatment conditions
have greatly different effects, this difference in treatment effect may
be accurately measured using a relatively small number of experimental
sessions. Where two treatment conditions have only slightly different
effects, a great many treatment sessions may be required in order to
detect and measure the size of the small treatment effect.

When an experiment consists of groups of subjects, the experimental and
control groups must contain sufficient subjects to enable the detection
of treatment effects over and above the variability in performance which
results from pre-experimental differences in the learning histories of
the subjects. This facet of experimental design is referred to as the
*statistical power* of the experiment (Cohen, 1988). Where the
experimental treatment has a relatively strong effect, the power to
detect treatment effects may be achieved with relatively small
experimental groups of 20 to 30 subjects. Where the experimental
treatment has only a weak effect, the power to detect treatment effects
may require experimental groups of several hundreds of subjects.
