Each of a set of to-be-acquired responses may be practised once, twice
or many times during the course of a single lesson, learning activity or
practice session. How often a particular response is practised during a
particular session depends upon the size of the practice set, the time
set aside for practice, and the length of time which the learner
requires in order to complete each practice response. Since learning
depends upon the number of times a new response is practised and the way
in which these practice opportunities are scheduled in time, it can be
seen that the size of the practice set and the number of practice
opportunities per session are important instructional variables.
