Careless, inappropriate, and antisocial behaviour often has aversive
outcomes. But it is possible for desirable, appropriate, and correct
responses to generate aversive consequences as well. A child may work
hard in class and complete all the set work ahead of time only to
discover that they are given more work to do -- a potentially aversive
consequence for working hard. A child may solve a maths problem using an
unusual procedure and have the solution marked wrong (because they used
the wrong procedure) -- a potentially aversive consequence for both
creativity and for producing the correct answer. A child may work hard
at a task which they find very difficult, only to be reprimanded for
failing to complete the task -- a potentially aversive consequence for
working as well as one is able to on an unreasonably difficult task.

One of the major causes of motivational problems in children of all ages
is the setting of tasks which are too difficult, which require much
effort, and which result in high levels of mistakes and negative
feedback. The effect of being required to work on such tasks is that the
child gradually loses interest and develops a dislike for this type of
task because working on such tasks too often generates aversive outcomes
and too infrequently generates reinforcing outcomes.
