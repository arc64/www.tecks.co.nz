Whether a particular behaviour is socially "appropriate" or
"inappropriate" is quite irrelevant when trying to identify the
contingency which is motivating continued use of that behaviour.
Desirable, appropriate, and correct responses often produce reinforcing
consequences. *But undesirable, inappropriate and incorrect responses
can produce reinforcing consequences too*.

While most parents and teachers try to ensure that only appropriate
responses are followed by reinforcing consequences, this aim is not
always achieved. A child who throws a tantrum may succeed in persuading
the parent to give the child what he or she wants -- with the result
that the parent inadvertently reinforces tantrumming. Inappropriate
attention seeking may succeed in attracting the pre-school teacher's
attention -- with the result that the pre-school teacher inadvertently
reinforces attention seeking. A student may make an error, the teacher
may praise the child (perhaps for effort) -- with the result that a
confusion on the part of the child is inadvertently reinforced. A
help-seeking response may work to produce help, even though the child
has reached the independence phase -- with the result that dependency is
inadvertently reinforced. One of the major causes of behaviour problems
in children of all ages occurs when children discover that inappropriate
behaviour works to get them something which they want.
