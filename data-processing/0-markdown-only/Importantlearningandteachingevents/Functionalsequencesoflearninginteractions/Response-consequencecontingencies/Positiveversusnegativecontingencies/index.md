Some behaviours make things appear and other behaviours make things go
away. A child can turn the radio on and make music *appear*. A child can
turn the radio off and make the music *go away*.

When a response, behaviour or action works to make something *appear*,
or to get, or to produce something which wasn\'t there before we refer
to the contingency (the response consequence relationship) as a
*positive contingency*. When a behaviour works to make something *go
away*, or to avoid something altogether, we refer to the contingency as
a *negative contingency.*

When we are talking about contingencies, the terms "positive" and
"negative" are used in the *mathematical* sense of adding something or
subtracting something from our immediate environment. These terms ***do
not*** refer to "good" and "bad" consequences and they ***do not***
refer to "nice" and "nasty" consequences.
