*Stimulus prompts are prompts which point backwards to important
features of a practice stimulus* -- features of the practice stimulus to
which the learner must attend in order to respond correctly. Let\'s say
that a child is learning to tell the time and makes an incorrect
response. If the child got the hour wrong, we might provide a stimulus
prompt by pointing to or touching the position of the hour hand on the
clock. If the child got the minutes wrong, we might provide a stimulus
prompt by pointing to the position of the minute hand on the clock.

There are many ways in which the learner\'s attention can be directed to
critical features of the practice stimulus. Three examples are pointing,
highlighting and the use of instructions.

**Pointing.** Attention may be prompted by pointing to an important part
of the display as in the example above where the teacher pointed to
either the hour hand or the minute hand of the clock following an error
in telling the time.

**Highlighting.** Attention may be prompted by simplifying the stimulus
display so that the important features of the display are more clearly
visible. For example, the distinction between yellow and orange might be
taught to a young child by temporarily ignoring colours other than
yellow and orange so that the child\'s attention was focused on the
single yellow/orange discrimination.

**Instructing.** Attention may be prompted using verbal instructions to
attend to particular features (e.g. "Notice how these sedimentary rocks
look and feel sandy to the touch"), or by prompting attention to the
definition which defines membership in a particular category ("Remember
that a hexagon has six sides").
