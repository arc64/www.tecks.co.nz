The practice stimuli which are provided for children to respond to can
occur in various modes: aural, visual, audio-visual, and so on.

Examples of practice stimuli presented in the *aural mode* include such
things as oral instructions to be followed, oral questions to be
answered, orally presented words to be spelled, orally presented
problems to be discussed, music to be analysed, and so on.

Practice stimuli which are presented in the *visual mode* may take a
variety of forms. They may consist of *objects,* as when a pre-school
provides equipment for children to play with, a geology teacher provides
rocks to be classified, a chemistry teacher provides chemicals to mix, a
music teacher provides instruments to be played, and so on. They may
consist of *pictures* as when a teacher presents pictures of objects to
be named, pictures of concept examples to be classified, diagrams to be
labelled, paintings to be analysed, and so on. Or they may take the form
of *symbols* as when a teacher presents letters and words to be copied
(e.g. during handwriting lessons), material to be read, texts to be
studied for their content, written questions to be answered, written
problems and exercises to be worked, music to be read and played, and so
on.
