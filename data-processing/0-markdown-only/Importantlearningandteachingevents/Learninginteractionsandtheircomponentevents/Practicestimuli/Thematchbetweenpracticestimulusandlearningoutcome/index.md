If I am trying to improve a child's reading (reading is the learning
outcome) and I provide a story for the child to read (the story is the
practice stimulus), there is likely to be a close match between the
child's practice responses and the intended learning outcome. If,
however, I seek to improve the child's reading skills and I read the
child a story while the child listens there is little or no match
between the practice stimulus (listening to a story) and the desired
learning outcome (independent reading).

The phrase "match between practice stimulus and learning outcome" refers
to the degree of correspondence between the practice stimuli which are
being used during practice and the test stimuli which will be used in
assessing the child's progress towards the desired learning outcome. In
everyday language we might talk about the "relevance" of the practice
activities in relation to the learning outcome which these practice
activities are intended to foster. Although there has been little
research into the matter, it seems self-evident that practice stimuli
which result in practice of the responses listed in the teaching aim are
more likely to move the child towards achievement of that aim than
practice stimuli which result in the practice of responses which are not
included in the teaching aim.
