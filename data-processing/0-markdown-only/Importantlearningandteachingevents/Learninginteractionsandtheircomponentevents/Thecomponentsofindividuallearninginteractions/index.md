By definition, the changes which we refer to as learning are changes
which are occurring as a result of experience, that is, as a result of
the learner's *interaction* with his or her environment. Interactions
are the building blocks of the learning process. *A learning interaction
consists of a single learner response together with the event or events
which the learner is responding to plus any immediate consequences which
result from that response*. Individual interactions (e.g. writing a
word) typically occur as part of a sequence of interactions (e.g.
writing a story). However, we must be able to identify and to analyse
individual interactions because it is at the level of the individual
interaction that learning occurs. (Writing a single word may result in
the child learning how to spell that word, for example.)
