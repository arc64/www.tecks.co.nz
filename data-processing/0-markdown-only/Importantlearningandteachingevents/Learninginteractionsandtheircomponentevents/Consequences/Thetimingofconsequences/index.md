The consequence which follows a practice response may follow
immediately, or after a short delay, or after a long delay. We will
refer to the interval between responses and consequence as the
*post-response interval*. *The post-response interval is the time which
elapses between completion of the learner\'s response to the practice
stimulus and the presentation of any consequence by the teacher, or by
the instructional medium, or by the environment.* The post-response
interval is not the same as "wait-time" which refers to the interval of
time occurring between when a teacher asks a question and when he/she
calls on a particular student to respond.

The time which elapses between response and consequence is an important
instructional variable because reinforcing consequences have their
strongest effect when they immediately follow correct responses whereas
error corrections have their strongest effect if they follow after a
short delay (long enough for the learner to self correct if they are
able to).
