It is quite impossible for a single teacher to monitor progress on all
of the dozens of learning objectives typically pursued during the course
of a teaching day. This means that progress monitoring must be limited
to selected learning outcomes -- presumably those which the teacher
judges to be most important.

It is likely that decisions regarding the teaching aims which are and
are not to be monitored function as major determinants of classroom
learning. Variability with respect to the particular learning outcomes
which the teacher chooses to observe and record is therefore likely to
be one of the factors which contributes to variability in the progress
of individual students in the setting of the classroom.
