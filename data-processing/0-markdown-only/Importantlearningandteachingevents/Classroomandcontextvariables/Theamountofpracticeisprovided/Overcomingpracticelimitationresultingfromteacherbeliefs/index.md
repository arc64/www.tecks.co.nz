Although it is not often publicly stated, teachers are often not all
that knowledgeable with respect to the conditions affecting learning and
are often unaware of the amount of practice required in order to learn
and remember something, unaware of differences in the amount of practice
required in order to achieve different kinds of learning outcomes and
unaware of the way in which the scheduling of practice in time operates
to inhibit or enhance the learning and remembering of new responses and
ideas. This factor also introduces variability in the practice
experienced by students from one classroom to the next.
