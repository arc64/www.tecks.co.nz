Classroom teaching occurs in a social context. This social context can
vary in many ways. It can vary with respect to the extent to which the
school operates in a well organised and efficient fashion, the physical
facilities provided by the school, the collective knowledge of teaching
colleagues, the number of students in the class, the degree of diversity
amongst these students, the ability of these students to tutor each
other, and so on.
