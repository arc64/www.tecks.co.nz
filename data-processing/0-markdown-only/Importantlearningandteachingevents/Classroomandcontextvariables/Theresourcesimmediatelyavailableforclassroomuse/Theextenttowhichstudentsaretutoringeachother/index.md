Modern western-style classrooms tend to be organised so that the
students are spending much of their time working on tasks in peer-led
groups of various kinds. Included here are all of the peer-tutoring
activities, the co-operative group activities, and the informal peer
guidance (and interference) activities which occur throughout the
teaching day.

A number of observers (e.g. Alton-Lee, 2003; Brophy, 2001;
Darling-Hammond, 1997) have worked to popularise the concept of the
classroom as a "learning community" that is, the classroom as a context
in which students "assume individual and group responsibilities for
managing instructional materials and activities and for supporting the
personal, social and academic well-being of all members of the classroom
community" (Brophy, 2001, p. 6). This work reminds us that classrooms
can vary with respect to the degree to which students help each other,
tutor each other, and otherwise act to facilitate the learning of their
peers in the classroom.

Although much has been written on the classroom as a learning community,
little attention has been given to how we might best measure variations
in the degree to which students help each other in particular
classrooms. Clearly, until educational researchers work out how to
measure degree of "learning communityness" it will be difficult to
design research into the effects which this aspect of classroom life
have on the academic development of the students who comprise this
community.
