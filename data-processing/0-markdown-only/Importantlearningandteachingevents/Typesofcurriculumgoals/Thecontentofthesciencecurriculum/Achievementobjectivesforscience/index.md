Set out in the table below are the achievement objectives for each of
the 6 strands for the first three levels (Levels 1 to 3) of the Science
area of the New Zealand Curriculum.

**Level 1**

*In the Nature of Science strand students will:*

-   Appreciate that scientists ask questions about our world that lead
    to investigations and that open-mindedness is important because
    there may be more than one explanation.
-   Extend their experiences and personal explanations of the natural
    world through exploration, play, asking questions, and discussing
    simple models.
-   Build their language and develop their understandings of the many
    ways the natural world can be represented.
-   Explore and act on issues and questions that link their science
    learning to their daily living.

*In the Living World strand students will:*

-   Recognize that all living things have certain requirements so they
    can stay alive.
-   Recognize that living things are suited to their particular habitat.
-   Recognize that there are lots of different living things in the
    world and that they can be grouped in different ways.
-   Explain how we know that some living things from the past are now
    extinct.

*In the Planet Earth and Beyond strand students will:*

-   Explore and describe natural features and resources.
-   Describe how natural features are changed and resources affected by
    natural events and human actions.
-   Share ideas and observations about the Sun and the Moon and their
    physical effects on the heat and light available to Earth.

*In the Physical World strand students will*

-   Explore everyday examples of physical phenomena, such as movement,
    forces, electricity and magnetism, light, sound, waves, and heat.
-   Seek and describe simple patterns in physical phenomena.

*In the Material World strand students will*

-   Observe, describe, and compare physical and chemical properties of
    common materials and changes that occur when materials are mixed,
    heated, or cooled.
-   Find out about the uses of common materials and relate these to
    their observed properties.

    heated, or cooled.
-   Find out about the uses of common materials and relate these to
    their observed properties.

**Level 3**

*In the Nature of Science strand students will:*

-   Appreciate that science is a way of explaining the world and that
    science knowledge changes over time.
-   Identify ways in which scientists work together and provide evidence
    to support their ideas**.**
-   Build on prior experiences, working together to share and examine
    their own and others' knowledge.
-   Ask questions, find evidence, explore simple models, and carry out
    appropriate investigations to develop simple explanations.
-   Begin to use a range of scientific symbols, conventions, and
    vocabulary.
-   Engage with a range of science texts and begin to question the
    purposes for which these texts are constructed.
-   Use their growing science knowledge when considering issues of
    concern to them.
-   Explore various aspects of an issue and make decisions about
    possible actions.

*In the Living World strand students will:*

-   Recognize that there are life processes common to all living things
    and that these occur in different ways.
-   Explain how living things are suited to their particular habitat and
    how they respond to environmental changes, both natural and
    human-induced.
-   Begin to group plants, animals, and other living things into
    science-based classifications.
-   Explore how the groups of living things we have in the world have
    changed over long periods of time and appreciate that some living
    things in New Zealand are quite different from living things in
    other areas of the world.

*In the Planet Earth and Beyond strand students will:*

-   Appreciate that water, air, rocks and soil, and life forms make up
    our planet and recognize that these are also Earth's resources.
-   Investigate the water cycle and its effect on climate, landforms,
    and life.
-   Investigate the components of the solar system, developing an
    appreciation of the distances between them.

*In the Physical World strand students will:*

-   Explore, describe, and represent patterns and trends for everyday
    examples of physical phenomena, such as movement, forces,
    electricity and magnetism, light, sound, waves, and heat. For
    example, identify and describe the effect of forces (contact and
    non-contact) on the motion of objects; identify and describe
    everyday examples of sources of energy, forms of energy, and energy
    transformations.

*In the Material World strand students will:*

-   Group materials in different ways, based on the observations and
    measurements of the characteristic chemical and physical properties
    of a range of different materials.
-   Compare chemical and physical changes.
-   Relate the observed, characteristic chemical and physical properties
    of a range of different materials to technological uses and natural
    processes.

Because the 2007 science curriculum does not even specify sample topics
for each achievement objective, it is likely that most teachers will
continue to use the teaching resources developed for the 1993 science
curriculum. These include *Developing Science Programmes* (Ministry of
Education, 1995a) and *Investigating in Science* (Ministry of Education,
1995b). The first provided an expanded account of learning and teaching
processes in science and suggested a range of practical ideas for
teachers to consider at each level. The second (which is now out of
print) provided examples of different types of investigations which
students can employ to solve problems, test explanations, and try out
and clarify ideas.

A second set of resources consists of a set of four publications
(Ministry of Education, 1998, 1999a, 1999b, 2001) designed to provide
important science information for Year 1 to 8 teachers and suggestions
for curriculum-linked science activities and investigations which can be
used at these levels. The first, *Making Better Sense of the Material
World* (Ministry of Education, 1998) focuses on chemistry. The first
chapter covers programme planning and implementation and the second
describes important chemical principles that teachers need to
understand. Each of the subsequent ten chapters presents a scientific
focus on a particular material such as milk, clay, paper, and so on.

The second, *Making Better Sense of the Physical World* (Ministry of
Education, 1999a) focuses on physics. The first two chapters cover
programme planning and the important physics principles that teachers
need to understand to help year 1 to 8 students gain physics-related
knowledge and skills. The remaining six chapters focus on the science of
sound, light and colour, electricity, and so on.

The third *Making Better Sense of Planet Earth and Beyond* (Ministry of
Education, 1999b) focuses on the Planet Earth and Beyond strand and
includes chapters on programme planning, important science principles
that teachers need to understand, and chapters on landforms, weather,
and astronomy.

The fourth, *Making Better Sense of the Living World* (Ministry of
Education, 2001) includes important science principles that teachers
need to understand and chapters on classification, structure and
function; and life stages and genetics.
