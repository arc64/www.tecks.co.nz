To summarise: most human behaviours are actions, that is, they are
behaviours which are undertaken for some purpose and which have effects
in the sense that the action may be successful or unsuccessful in
achieving its intended purpose.

When evaluating a research report which claims to be about the
conditions under which learning occurs, or about the effects of teaching
on learning, the reader must first establish that what was observed and
measured was in fact learning. That is, the reader must establish that
what was observed and measured was a *change* in learner competence,
observed or measured using a procedure which enabled the researcher to
*track one or more action-and-purpose units and their effects over
time*, and *reported separately for each of the individual learners* who
took part in the experiment. An investigation which fails to meet any of
these requirements is unlikely to qualify as a scientific study of
learning. It can be seen, therefore, that, as a subject matter for study
and scientific research, learning has a number of characteristics which
make its observation and measurement somewhat difficult.
