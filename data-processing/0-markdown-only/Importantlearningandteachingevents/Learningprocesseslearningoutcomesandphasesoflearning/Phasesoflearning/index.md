Learning involves change. These changes may continue for some time.
Improvements in a skill such as handwriting, for example, may continue
for several years. Both behavioural scientists and cognitive scientists
distinguish between a number of phases of the learning process. These
phases are distinguished because (a) the type of practice required in
order to move from one phase to the next changes from phase to phase and
because (b) different measurement procedures are required to measure
improvement within each of the several different phases.

In this account we will distinguish between the acquisition phase, the
fluency building phase, the endurance phase, the generalisation phase
and the adaptation phase. These distinctions are similar to the
distinctions described by Johnson and Layng (1992) and can be traced
back to the earlier work of Haughton (1972) and Lindsley (1972).
