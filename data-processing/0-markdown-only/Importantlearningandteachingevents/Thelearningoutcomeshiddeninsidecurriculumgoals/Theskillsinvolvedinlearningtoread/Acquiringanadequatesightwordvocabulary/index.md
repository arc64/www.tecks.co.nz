After a certain amount of practice, the learner acquires the ability to
instantly recognise particular printed words. In this account we will
refer to those words which the learner instantly recognises as *sight
words* and the number of words which the learner can instantly recognise
as the learner's *sight word vocabulary*. The acquisition of an adequate
sight word vocabulary at each age level is necessary for normal reading
development because an adequate level of reading fluency, and hence
comprehension, is only possible if the child instantly recognises most
of the words in the texts which are being used for reading practice.

It is thought that the acquisition of a functional level of knowledge of
grapheme-phoneme relations is an essential step on the way to reading
competence because this knowledge allows the learner to decode new words
*without having to ask a teacher or peer to pronounce the word for*
them. This metacognitive skill has been referred to as "self-teaching"
(Share, 1995; Share & Stanovich, 1995) although it is more appropriately
referred to as *self-decoding*. The development of self-decoding skills
allows the child to *independently* acquire the final equivalence
relation necessary in order for a new printed word to be added to the
child's sight word vocabulary. It is thought that some kind of
self-teaching process is the only kind of process which could
conceivably account for the explosive growth which occurs in the
normally developing child\'s sight word vocabulary during the first four
years of reading instruction (Share & Stanovich, 1995).
