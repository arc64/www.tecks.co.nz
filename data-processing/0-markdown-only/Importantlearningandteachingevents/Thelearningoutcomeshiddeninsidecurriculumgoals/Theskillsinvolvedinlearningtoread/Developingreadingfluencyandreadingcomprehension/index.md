Reading fluency and reading comprehension are closely linked.
Comprehension remains tenuous until the learner can read grade level
text at 120 correct words per minute -- a level which is reached by the
average child after about four years of schooling (Hasbrouck & Tindal,
2006).

In order to accomplish this level of reading fluency, the learner needs
to complete very large amounts of reading practice. Large amounts of
reading practice are required in order to ensure that the majority of
words in the text are instantly recognised (without having to be decoded
letter by letter).
