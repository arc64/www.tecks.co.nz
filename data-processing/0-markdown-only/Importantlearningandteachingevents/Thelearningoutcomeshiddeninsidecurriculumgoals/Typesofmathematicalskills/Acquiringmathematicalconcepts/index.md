Mathematics curricula are "conceptually dense". This means that even
during the early years, the child is faced with the task of mastering
large numbers of mathematical concepts. Concepts in the early
mathematics curriculum include the names and symbols used to represent
whole number quantities from 0 to 100, place value concepts and common
fractions; the ordinal concepts ("1st", "2nd", "3rd" and so on); the
common measurement units such as "minute", "centimetre" and so on; basic
mathematical relations such as "equality", "greater than", "less than",
and so on; the four basic operations of addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division; the single digit addition and subtraction
facts and the single digit multiplication and division facts.

Some mathematical concepts refer to quantities (e.g. "five"), some refer
to values (e.g. "five centimetres" etc.), some refer to cardinality
(e.g. "first", "fifth" etc.), and some refer to relations (e.g.
"equals", "less", "least", "smaller", "shorter", etc.). In order to
achieve a well developed understanding of any particular mathematical
concept, the child must experience the opportunity to work with a wide
variety of examples (representations) of the concept together with many
opportunities to distinguish between examples and non-examples of the
concept (Church, 1999; Engelmann & Carnine, 1991; Kameenui & Simmons,
1990). This means that the ability to identify mathematical concepts is
an essential skill for anyone involve in the planning of effective maths
lessons.

Conceptual understanding is demonstrated when the child can discriminate
between never-before-seen examples and non-examples of the concept and
can correctly name the new examples (Church, 1999; Engelmann & Carnine,
1991; Tiemann & Markle, 1990). This skill is variously referred to as
"understanding", "generalisation" or "transfer". Many mathematical
concepts such as "greater than/less than", "larger/smaller" and so on
are relational concepts. Relational concepts are more difficult to teach
than classification concepts because they require the use of teaching
examples which involve comparisons rather than examples which simply
involve classification.
