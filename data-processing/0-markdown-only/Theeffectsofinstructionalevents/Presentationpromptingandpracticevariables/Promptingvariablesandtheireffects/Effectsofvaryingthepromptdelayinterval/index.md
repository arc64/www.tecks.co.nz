The experimental research into delayed prompting procedures tends to use
a prompt delay interval of between 3 and 6 seconds. Since learners who
are just beginning to acquire a new response may take some time to
recall the correct response, the prompt delay interval must be long
enough to allow this process to occur. However, there do not appear to
be any parametric studies of the effects on rate of acquisition of
varying the prompt delay interval during the acquisition of different
kinds of learning outcomes or with learners at different stages of
development.
