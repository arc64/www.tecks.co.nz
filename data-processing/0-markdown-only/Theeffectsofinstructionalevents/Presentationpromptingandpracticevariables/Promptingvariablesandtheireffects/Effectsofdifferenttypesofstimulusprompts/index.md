There are only half of dozen experimental studies of stimulus prompting
procedures during instruction and most of these are studies of stimulus
fading procedures involving children and adults with intellectual
disabilities. While these studies demonstrate that errorless
discrimination learning is possible (Hively, 1966) the research does not
yet allow us to draw any conclusions regarding the relative
effectiveness or efficiency of different stimulus prompting procedures
in the classroom.
