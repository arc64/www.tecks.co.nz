Prompting procedures (sometimes referred to as scaffolding) show the
learner how to respond or how to respond correctly. They therefore play
a critical role in all situations where the learner does not yet know
how to respond. Prompting procedures may vary with respect to the number
of responses prompted, the proportion of responses prompted, whether or
not the prompt remains in view during practice, whether the prompt
occurs before or after the practice stimulus and the degree to which the
prompting procedure results in the learner practising correct responses
rather than errors. Prompts can also vary according to whether they are
stimulus prompts or behaviour prompts, there are different types of
stimulus prompts and behaviour prompts, and there a number of ways of
fading prompts once they are no longer necessary.

Because prompts play a critical role during the initial phases of
instruction, it is not surprising to find that prompting procedures have
been the focus of a considerable amount of controlled experimental
research. As a result, learning researchers now have a reasonably good
understanding of the effects of different types of prompting
arrangements.
