Everyone knows from practical experience than in order to remember
something new a certain amount of practice is required. Practical
experience also teaches us that in order to master a new skill a
considerable amount of practice is often required. The critical question
is "How much practice?" Sometimes this problem is solved by setting a
performance criterion or "exit criterion" and by requiring students to
practice until they meet this criterion. This simply changes the
question to "How is the performance criterion to be determined?"
