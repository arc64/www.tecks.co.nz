While the research reviewed in the preceding section begins to provide
answers to the practical question of how much practice and review a
teacher should provide, it is research which will be difficult to apply
in practice. This is because a classroom consists of dozens of learners
practising dozens of knowledge items and skills every day and it is
impossible for the classroom teacher to monitor and record the learning
opportunities experienced by each individual student from day to day. A
more practical approach is to select some kind of performance criterion
and to ask students to continue practising until they reach that
performance criterion. The performance criterion which is most important
is the *exit criterion* which is used to determine when an individual
student should cease practising a particular set of academic responses,
exit that unit of work, and move on to the next unit of work.

The most widely cited example of a teaching programme which uses
specified exit criteria for each of the teaching objectives in each of
the basic skills contained in the primary school curriculum is that
developed by Kent Johnson for a private school called Morningside
Academy in Seattle. The curriculum, the teaching procedures, and the
rates of progress of Morningside students have been described in several
reports (Johnson & Layng, 1992, 1994). Almost all of the students who
enrol at Morningside are students with diagnosed learning difficulties
or attention deficit disorder or both. In general terms, these students
make rates of progress in reading, language arts and maths (as measured
by standardised achievement tests) which are two times to three times
faster than that made by the average American child.

The exit criteria used at Morningside are fluency criteria and there is
an emerging consensus amongst those who are studying fluency building
that the exit criteria for basic literacy and numeracy skills should
always be fluency criteria (e.g., Binder, 1996; Binder, Haughton &
Bateman, 2002; Johnson & Layng, 1992; Kubina & Morrison, 2000). This is
because fluency, not achievement or accuracy, is the best predictor of
long term recall (Bullara, Kimball & Cooper, 1993; Ivarie, 1986;
Olander, Collins, McArthur, Watts, & McDade, 1986; Shirley &
Pennypacker, 1994; Sterling, Goetz & Sterling, 1984).

As the research into fluency has evolved, practitioners have developed
lists of fluency-based exit criteria (e.g., Binder et al., 2002) which
can be used by teachers who seek to ensure that basic skills have been
sufficiently well practised for them to be remembered over the long
term.

It is important to note, however, that there is little or no parametric
research into fluency, that is, almost no research comparing the level
of retention which results from variations in fluency-based exit
criteria. Studies of the long term effects of building basic skills to
differing levels of fluency must be considered to be one of the most
important next steps in the research into learning and teaching.
