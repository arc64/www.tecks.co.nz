Practice activities often consist of a mixture of new and previously
acquired responses. The technical name for this is *interspersal
training* -- because new (yet-to-be-acquired) and old (previously
acquired) items are interspersed within the practice set. The effects of
various interspersal ratios on a variety of learning outcomes have been
reviewed by Skinner (2002) and by Cates (2005).

Most of the studies of the effects of interspersing yet-to-be-learned
and previously learned responses have involved the learning of spelling
words, sight words, or maths facts. Experimental studies of interspersal
training sometimes find that it results in more rapid acquisition of new
responses (Cook & Reichard, 1996; Cooke, Guzakas, Pressley & Kerr, 1993;
Dunlap, 1984; Koegel & Koegel, 1986; Neef, Iwata & Page, 1977, 1980) and
sometimes find that interspersal formats result in similar (or slower)
rates of acquisition than practice with all new items (Cooke, Guzakas,
Pressley & Kerr, 1993; Cuvo, Davis & Gluck, 1991; Joseph & Nist, 2006).

Several parametric studies of interspersal ratios been undertaken.
Roberts, Turco, and Shapiro (1991) measured the effects of four
interspersal ratios (50% unknown, 40% unknown, 20% unknown and 10%
unknown) on a sight word learning task presented on flash cards over a
series of 24 sessions. Students in the 50/50 condition learned to
recognise the largest number of words and students in the 10/90
condition learned the smallest number of words. In a follow-up
experiment, Roberts and Shapiro (1996) studied the effects of
interspersal ratios of 90%, 50% and 20% unknown sight words and found
that rate of acquisition increased as the ratio of unknown to known
words increased. Cook and Reichard (1996) compared the effects of three
interspersal ratios (70% unknown, 50%, unknown, 30% unknown) on the
acquisition of multiplication and division facts in six 10- to 12-year
old students with learning disabilities. Reciprocal peer-tutoring was
used to deliver flashcard sessions. Most of the students made more rapid
gains in the 70% unknown condition.

A number of recent studies have explored the effects of interspersal
training activities on student liking for these activities and have
found that students express a preference for learning tasks where
exercises which take some time to complete are interspersed with simpler
exercises which can be quickly completed (Cates, Skinner, Watkins,
Rhymer, McNeil & McCurdy, 1999; Johns, Skinner & Nail, 2000; Wildmon,
Skinner & McDade, 1998; Wildmon, Skinner, McCurdy & Sims, 1999; Skinner,
Hall-Johnson, Skinner, Cates, Weber & Johns, 1999; Skinner, Fletcher,
Wildmon & Belfiore, 1996; Skinner, Robinson, Johns, Logan & Belfiore,
1996). In all of these studies, the shorter exercises are additional, to
the main exercises so the preference for the interspersal learning tasks
is a preference for interspersal activities even although this actually
involves more work. Although many of these studies have involved college
students, three have involved high school students (Cates & Skinner,
2000; Johns et al., 2000; Wildmon et al., 1999) and one (Logan &
Skinner, 1998) has involved primary school students.

The interspersal procedure has also been observed to result in increased
levels of on-task behaviour in the classroom (McCurdy, Skinner,
Grantham, Watson & Hindman, 2001).

Why does the interspersal procedure have these effects? The majority
view at the present time is that the faster learning which occurs with
interspersal practice is due to the fact that the learner experiences a
higher accuracy level during practice with interspersal sets, that
getting answers correct is reinforcing, and that working on interspersal
sets is, therefore, more reinforcing than working on "all new" practice
tasks (Skinner, 2002). "While working on . . . assignments with many
discrete tasks, the completion of each task may be a conditioned
reinforcer (Logan & Skinner, 1998). Thus by interspersing additional
brief problems, educators may increase rates of problem completion and
rates of reinforcement" (Skinner, Wallace & Neddenriep, 2002, p. 61).
Strong support for this point of view is provided by the fact that, when
given a choice, students choose interspersal practice activities over
"all new" activities even when the interspersal activity involves extra
work (for example, a larger number of exercises to complete) (Cates
2005).

However, it may also be the case that interspersal training provides
more effective and error-free discrimination training. It will be
recalled that, in learning to respond correctly to new stimuli, the
learner must not only learn which response to give to the new stimulus
but must also learn to discriminate the new stimulus from other stimuli
in the set. Practice sets which include old as well as new items provide
the learner with both kinds of practice (practice in discriminating the
new stimulus from other stimuli as well as practice in responding
correctly). By including previously mastered items in the current
practice set, it is possible for the teacher to include (previously
mastered) stimulus items which are similar in appearance to the new
items. This hastens development of the discrimination between similar
looking items. It may be that this is why the strongest effect of the
interspersal procedure on rate of acquisition is seen when students are
practising basic maths facts.

During practice we want the student to get more practice with new items
than with previously learned items. This can be achieved in a number of
ways. One way (if flashcards are being used) is to return the new items
(once they have been responded to) to the middle of the set of, say, 10
cards (instead of returning them to the end of the pack). In this way,
the student gets twice as much practice with new items as they get with
old items. A variation of this procedure is to return *incorrectly
answered* items to the middle of the pack and correctly answered items
to the end of the pack (Van Houten & Rolider, 1989).
