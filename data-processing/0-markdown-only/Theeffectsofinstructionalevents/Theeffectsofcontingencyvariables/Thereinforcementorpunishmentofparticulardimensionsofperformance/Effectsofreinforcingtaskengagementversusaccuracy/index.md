In the classroom, the consequences which are being used to motive
improvements in performance can be made contingent on engagement
(attending to the task in hand), productivity (completing the task in
hand), improvements in performance accuracy, or improvements in fluency.

**Reinforcing time on task and productivity**

Attention to practice stimuli, engagement with learning tasks, and
staying on task until learning activities are completed are essential
prerequisites for learning. Where learning tasks are difficult for the
learner, or disliked by the learner, the teacher may need to begin by
simply reinforcing improvements in time on task or task completion.

Where the aim is to shape task engagement, classroom reinforcers may be
made contingent on time on task, or on the amount of work completed.
This kind of contingency almost always produces rapid and marked
increases in time on task and work completed as indicated earlier in
this section. However, because reinforcement is not contingent upon
accuracy or quality, the reinforcement of task completion may result in
no change or improvement in the quality of the work completed (e.g.,
Ferritor, Buckholdt, Hamblin & Smith, 1972; Hundert, Bucher & Henderson,
1976).

**Reinforcing accurate performance**

It is clear from the earlier section on reinforcing accurate
performances that the reinforcement of correct responses almost always
results in an increase in the proportion of correct responses. A number
of these studies have further demonstrated that the reinforcement of
correct responding nearly always results in an increase in time on task,
task engagement and productivity (Broughton & Lahey, 1978; Ferritor et
al., 1972; Hundert et al., 1976; Marholin & Steinman, 1977). The reason
for this is fairly obvious. Unless the student attends, concentrates,
and works at producing accurate responses, no reinforcement is
forthcoming.

However, reinforcing accurate performance has a down side as well. If
reinforcement is made contingent upon the number of correct responses,
there is no incentive to respond quickly. In fact, the pupil may be
motivated to work conscientiously, that is, *slowly* and carefully in an
attempt to maximise the number of correct responses (Eisenberger,
Mitchell, McDermitt & Masterson, 1984). Reinforcing accuracy, in other
words, may work against the development of mastery. Since mastery is
always a long term aim of instruction (at least in basic skills) it
follows that the reinforcement of accuracy is a procedure which should
only be used during the transition from the initial learning phase to
the independence phase of the learning cycle and not where the teaching
aim is to build mastery, that is, fast and accurate performance.

**Reinforcing fluent performance**

A third dimension of classroom performance is the *fluency dimension*,
that is, fast and accurate responding. Where the objective of practice
is to develop mastery, classroom reinforcers must be made contingent
upon improvements in the *speed* with which the learner can recall
correct responses, that is, contingent on improvements in the rate of
accurate responding. When improvements in fluency are reinforced, speed
improves and accuracy also continues to improve (e.g. Faykus & McCurdy,
1998; McEvoy & Brady, 1988; McDowell & Keenan, 2001; Schloss, Sedlak,
Elliot & Smothers, 1982).

Informal accounts of student performance during fluency building
sessions suggest that, when classroom reinforcers are made contingent
upon improvements in fluency, task engagement tends to be maintained at
a high level. However, there appear to be no experimental demonstrations
of this effect.
