Time out from the current activity is widely used by parents as a
punishment for defiance and other kinds of misbehaviour. It is also the
punishment procedure recommended in most modern books on parenting
(e.g., Sanders, 1992**)** and in most evidence-based parent management
training programmes (e.g., McMahon & Forehand, 2003**)**.

While much of the research into time out has been undertaken within the
context of parenting training where it is just one of the skills which
parents are acquiring, there have been at least 15 controlled studies of
time out from reinforcement which have been undertaken in classroom
settings.

Sherburne, Utley, McConnell & Gannon (1988) found that a well designed
time out contingency for antisocial behaviour motivated more rapid
suppression of antisocial behaviour than reminders to play nicely in 3-
to 5-year old children with behaviour problems. Baer, Rowberry and Baer
(1973) found that time out for noncompliance accelerated the development
of compliance in two 4- to 6-year olds whose compliance was not strongly
affected by a positive reinforcement contingency alone. When Osnes,
Guevremon and Stokes (1987) attempted to teach appropriate social
interaction to a 4 year old girl with intellectual disabilities using
positive consequences alone, they had little success until they added a
brief time-out for inappropriate social responses. Northup et al. (1999)
found that time out reduced the disruptive and off task behaviour of
three boys with ADHD and that this effect occurred regardless of whether
the students were receiving methyphenidate or a placebo.

Both inclusionary and exclusionary time out have been studied with
inclusionary time out having suppressive effects which are similar to
those observed with exclusionary time out (Foxx & Shapiro, 1978).

The effectiveness of time out depends to some extent to the punishment
schedule with time-out following each disruptive response producing
faster suppression than is the case with more intermittent schedules
(Clark, Rowberry, Baer & Baer, 1973).
