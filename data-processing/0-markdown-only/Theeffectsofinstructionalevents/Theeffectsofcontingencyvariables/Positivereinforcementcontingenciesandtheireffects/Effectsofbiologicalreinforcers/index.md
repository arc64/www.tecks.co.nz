By and large, the use of biological reinforcers is considered to be
inappropriate in early childhood centres and schools in New Zealand.
However, some exceptions can be found. It is sometimes considered
appropriate to use food rewards or food voucher rewards to motivate
improvements in work habits, concentration, homework completion and so
on in poorly motivated, underachieving or antisocial secondary school
students and most studies have found that such rewards motivate large
and rapid improvements in task engagement and work completion with these
types of students (e.g., Lloyd & Hilliard, 1989; Wolf, Giles & Hall,
1986). There are also a number of examples of the use of small edibles
such as chips, nuts and raisins to motivate attention and responding in
special education settings in children with intellectual disabilities or
autism (e.g., Egel, 1981; Mayhew & Anderson, 1980).

Of the biological reinforcers, sensory stimulation is probably the most
useful in the classroom setting. The main way to maintain reinforcing
levels of sensory stimulation in the classroom is to ensure adequate
levels of variety both within and across learning activities from hour
to hour and day to day (Church, 1999). When student interest begins to
flag sensory stimulation may be increased by changing the content of
instruction (e.g. from reading to science to physical education and so
on), by changing the type of learning activity (e.g. from whole class to
group work to individual work and so on), by changing the type of
learning outcome being pursued (e.g. from prompted practice to fluency
building and vice versa), or by changing the mode of the activity (e.g.
from watching a DVD, to discussion, to independent practice, and so on).

Interestingly, this is a very neglected area. We have been unable to
find any controlled experimental analyses of the effects of changing
levels of sensory stimulation or variety on learning or motivation in
the classroom setting.
