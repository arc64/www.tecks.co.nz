It is possible for appropriate behaviour to have punishing as well as
reinforcing outcomes. A child may attempt to negotiate an unreasonable
demand but be punished for failing to comply. A child may work hard at a
very difficult task which they find very difficult, only to be
reprimanded for failing to complete the task.

One of the major causes of motivational problems in the classroom (for
children of all ages) is the setting of tasks which are too difficult.
Being asked repeatedly to work on learning tasks which are too difficult
to complete successfully tends to produce reduced levels of interest,
motivation, and self-confidence (e.g. Schumm, Moody & Vaughn, 2000).

There is some evidence to suggest that classroom teachers experience
difficulty in ensuring that all of the children in a diverse classroom
are placed on reading materials of the appropriate level of difficulty
(Schumm et al., 2000) and the same problem has been observed in New
Zealand studies (Shearer, 1999). Schumm et al. (2000) reported that in
23 of the 29 third grade classrooms in their sample, the reading
programme was class-based with all of the children working on the same
reading materials. As a result \"the students with reading and learning
disabilities demonstrated minimal gains. In general, students\'
self-concept about themselves also plateaued, while their attitudes
toward reading declined\" (Schumm et al., 2000, p. 486).

Little research has been undertaken into the effects of placing students
(or failing to place students) on learning tasks which result in
adequate levels of success. (Possibly this is because the need to employ
learning tasks at an appropriate level of difficulty is so self-evident
that it appears not to require experimental analysis.) Kameenui, Carnine
and Freschi (1982) examined the effect of changing a difficult text so
that it was more readily understood by 60 9- to 11-year old students.
This was achieved by replacing the most difficult words with words
likely to be understood by this age group. The effect of making the text
more comprehensible to the students was to increase both post-study
comprehension scores and retention scores. Morris, Blanton, Blanton,
Nowacek and Perney (1995) compared the effects of assigning 48 3rd grade
poor spellers to either a 2nd grade spelling curriculum (experimental
group) or 3rd grade spelling curriculum (contrast group) for one school
year. At the end of the year, the experimental group students obtained
higher scores than the contrast group on the 2nd grade end-of-year
spelling test and obtained similar scores to the contrast students on
the 3rd grade end-of-year spelling test. Daly, Martens, Kilmer and
Massie (1996) instructed four students with mild disabilities using
passages at two levels of text difficulty (instructionally matched and
instructionally mismatched). Students' oral reading accuracy and fluency
on subsequent test passages showed a greater degree of generalization
when instructional materials were matched to the students' skill level.

There is, then, some experimental evidence to support the commonly held
view that classroom tasks which are too difficult result in declining
motivation and declining achievement -- presumably because of the
elevated rates of punishment (failure) which they generate.
