A variety of punishment contingencies are possible: positive punishment
contingencies (in which misbehaviour results in an aversive outcome) and
negative punishment contingencies (where misbehaviour results in a loss
of reinforcement or a loss of access to reinforcement). The aversive
outcome in a positive punishment contingency may be a naturally
occurring outcome (such as the pain which results from getting into a
shower which is too hot), a biological aversive consequence (such as the
hangover which results from drinking too much the night before), the
requirement to engage in an effortful, unpleasant or disliked task, a
socially mediated consequence (such as disapproval), or the negative
feedback which often follows incorrect responses and unsuccessful
attempts.

Although widely used as instruments of social control, positive
punishment contingencies have been little studied. This is because
positive punishment is widely discouraged, if not prohibited, in
educational settings and because ethics committees rarely approve
proposals to investigate the effects of punishment on the behaviour of
human subjects.
