The biological punishers include unpleasant tastes, smells and sounds,
events which cause discomfort, events which cause pain, events which
cause anxiety and fear, events which cause nausea, and so on. Because of
ethical concerns, experimental analysis of the effects of biological
punishers is largely limited to studies involving laboratory animals.
However, the human learning literature does include half a dozen case
experiments involving biological punishers. The aversive events which
have been studied in these experiments include water sprays to the face,
ammonia sprays to the nose, lemon juice/citric acid sprays to the mouth,
single smacks, and mild electric shock.

Several studies (e.g., Altman, Grahs & Friman, 1982; Watson, Dittmer &
Ray, 2000) have found that thumb sucking is rapidly suppressed when a
bad tasting patch is attached to the child's thumb.

Gross, Berler and Drabman (1982) used a water squirt to the face to
rapidly suppress aggressive responses in a 4 year old boy with
intellectual disabilities. Doke, Wolery and Sumberg (1983) used an
ammonia spray following aggression in a 7 year old boy with profound
intellectual disabilities. Aggression was immediately suppressed and
remained suppressed a year later. Mayhew and Harris (1979) used
contingent application of citric acid to the mouth following self-injury
and tantrum screaming in a 19 year old male with profound intellectual
disabilities and Gross, Wright & Drabman (1980) applied citric acid
following finger knawing in a 5 year old boy with severe intellectual
disabilities. In both cases the punished behaviours were rapidly
suppressed.

Romanczyk, Colletti and Plotkin (1980) describe the treatment of a 13
year old institutionalised boy with profound intellectual disabilities
who used screaming, self-injury and aggression to avoid certain kinds of
tasks. Treatment included a smack on the thigh when a targeted behaviour
occurred. Each behaviour was rapidly suppressed in turn and remained
suppressed without the need for any further physical punishment.

Creer, Chai & Hoffman (1977) report that the chronic coughing of a 14
year old male was rapidly suppressed following a treatment in which
coughing was followed by a mild electric shock to the forearm. There was
no reappearance of the coughing during follow-ups for 2 years. Kircher,
Pear and Martin (1971) found that two 6 year old children with
intellectual disabilities learned picture names when correct responses
were reinforced and learned picture names even more quickly when, in
addition, inattention and errors resulted in a mild electric shock.

Although the number of studies is small, these experiments indicate that
an inappropriate behaviour can be rapidly suppressed, without any
obvious side effects, using positive punishment administered on an FR1
(continuous) schedule. They further demonstrate that because suppression
is rapid and permanent, very few punishments are required and no further
punishment is required once suppression has occurred. However, it is
also the case that this form of treatment is prohibited in most
treatment settings and this has stimulated a search for alternative,
acceptable treatments of similar effectiveness.

It is often argued that punishment contingencies should not be used
because their effects (on the punished behaviour) are only temporary.
The research clearly does not support this claim. While an argument
against punishment can be made on ethical grounds, it cannot be made on
the grounds that punishment is ineffective or that its effects are only
temporary.
