One of the penalties commonly employed as a consequence for
inappropriate behaviour in the home setting is the "extra chore". There
has been little in the way of experimental analysis of the conditions
under which this penalty acts as a punishment contingency.

Luce, Delquadri and Hall (1980) studied the effects of requiring 7- and
10-yr-old boys with behaviour problems to sit then stand 5-20 times
following aggressive responses. This penalty resulted in rapid
suppression of aggressive responses -- indicating that the penalty was
functioning as a punishment contingency. Carstens (1980) studied the
effects of requiring a 4-year old fire-setting boy to complete 1 hour of
hard work following every instance of fire-setting or matches play and
found that this penalty completely suppressed these behaviours with no
recurrence at a 6 month follow-up. Fischer and Nehs (1978) reported that
the requirement to wash a window as a consequence of each instance of
swearing resulted in rapid and lasting cessation of swearing in an
11-year old boy. Kelly and Drabman (1977) found that positive practice
(being required to perform the appropriate alternative behaviour half a
dozen times in quick succession) resulted in rapidly reduced eye poking
by a 3-year old visually handicapped boy and Gibbs and Luyben (1985)
report that positive practice quickly suppressed self-injury in a
15-year old boy with intellectual disabilities.

The rapid suppression observed in each of these experiments indicates
that having to complete the chore or the positive practice as a penalty
for inappropriate behaviour functioned as a punishment contingency for
each of the behaviours studied in these experiments.
