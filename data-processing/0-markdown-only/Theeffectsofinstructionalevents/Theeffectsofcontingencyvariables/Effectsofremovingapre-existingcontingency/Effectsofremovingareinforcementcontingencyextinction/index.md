It is possible for the reinforcement which has motivated continued use
of a particular behaviour to be removed. The term *extinction* is the
term which we use to refer to cases where the learner's environment
undergoes a change such that a previously reinforced response no longer
works to produce the reinforcement which it used to produce. Under these
circumstances the behaviour which no longer works to produce
reinforcement is usually abandoned in favour of a behaviour which does
work. The extinction effect can occur following the withdrawal of
positive reinforcement and following the withdrawal of negative
reinforcement contingencies.

The extinction effect is sometimes observed following the withdrawal of
a programmed reinforcement contingency (e.g., McLaughlin & Malaby,
1975a, 1975b; Simon, Ayllon & Milan, 1982) and sometimes not observed
(e.g., Baer, Fowler, & Carden-Smith, 1984; Bailey Wolf & Phillips, 1970;
McNaughton, 1975).

Whether or not the extinction effect occurs seems to depend upon whether
or not the response is being maintained by a single source of
reinforcement or whether it is being maintained by multiple sources of
reinforcement. If the response is being maintained by a single source of
reinforcement, removal of that reinforcement results in extinction
(Simon et al., 1982). If the response is being maintained by several
sources of reinforcement, then the removal of one of these reinforcement
contingencies is unlikely to result in the response being abandoned. A
number of studies have shown that when the teacher first introduces a
strong reinforcement contingency to motivate performance of a particular
class of responses, and then carefully fades this contingency while
continuing to provide adequate levels of social reinforcement and
positive feedback, extinction is unlikely to occur.
