Our search for applied examples of avoidance contingencies identified
six experimental analyses. Four of these demonstrated the reinforcing
(motivating) effects of negative reinforcement contingencies in school
settings. Cote, Thompson and McKerchar (2005) found, in an experiment in
an early childhood setting, that the toddlers in that setting were more
likely to comply with teacher instructions when compliance avoided loss
of access to a toy. Hall, Cristler, Cranston & Tucker (1970) describe
(in Experiment 2) an arrangement in which Grade 10 (Year 11) students
could avoid "after school tutoring" provided they obtained a score of at
least 72% on daily quizzes testing that day's French vocabulary words.
This contingency motivated all students to engage in sufficient homework
to avoid the after school contingency. Witt and Elliott (1982) found
that three Year 5 students were strongly motivated to stay on task in
order to avoid being entered into a response cost lottery in which they
lost a fraction of their tickets to a reinforcing activity for drifting
off task. However, in a replication study involving Year 9 students
Proctor and Morgan (1991) found that the response cost lottery motivated
two of four students to stay on task but had much weaker effects on the
other two students.

Two further experiments compared the relative effectiveness of positive
reinforcement and negative reinforcement contingencies. Leach and Tan
(1996) found that students in two Grade 8 (Year 9) classes were more
motivated to stay on task when this was necessary in order to avoid a
negative note home to parents than when targeted levels of on-task
behaviour earned a positive note home to parents. Kidd and Saudergas
(1988) describe an experiment in which they measured the effects on task
completion and accuracy level in maths of the introduction of (a) a
positive reinforcement contingency (for meeting the daily target) plus a
negative contingency (for failing to meet the target) and (b) the
positive reinforcement contingency on its own. In contrast to the
results of the previous experiment, Kidd and Saudergas found that the
positive reinforcement contingency on its own was sufficient to maintain
high levels of completion and accuracy on daily maths assignments by two
upper primary school students.

These experiments show that negative reinforcement contingencies can
have powerful motivating effects and that, in certain cases, these
effects may be even more powerful than the effects of a positive
reinforcement contingency. It is this factor that probably accounts for
their widespread use. The results of these experiments also suggest that
the effect is likely to depend to some extent on the student's
perception of the likelihood that the punishing outcome will actually
occur if requirements are not met. However, these experiments have
little to say about the effects of negative reinforcement arrangements
on attitudes and long term motivation.
