Negative reinforcement contingencies are of two general types: escape
and avoidance. With an escape contingency, satisfactory performance is
necessary in order to escape from an aversive state of affairs. With an
avoidance contingency, satisfactory performance is required in order to
avoid an aversive outcome (in order to avoid punishment). Negative
reinforcement contingencies have been studied extensively in the
laboratory, are quite common in the secondary school setting, and are
even more common in the home setting. However, because they involve the
introduction of punishment contingencies (or the threat of punishment)
they have been the subject of very little experimental analysis in
either the school or the home setting.
