Chapter 1 consists of 5 sections. Section 1 identifies the most common
approaches to research in education. Section 2 examines the extent to
which each of these approaches to research have learning and/or teaching
as their primary subject matter. Section 3 examines the units of
analysis which are being used in research into learning. Section 4
identifies the different types of explanation which are possible and
Section 5 asks which of the several approaches to the study of learning
and teaching is most likely (a) to identify the conditions necessary in
order for different kind of learning to occur and hence most likely (b)
to identify the teaching procedures which are effective in developing
different kinds of learning outcomes in different kinds of learners
