For most of the 20th century, the intensive investigation of a single
site or context has been referred to as ethnography. Ethnographic
research methods were initially developed by social anthropologists
during the first two decades of the 20th century. Descriptions of the
historical development of ethnographic research methods will be found in
Bogdan & Biklen (1998), Erikson (1986), and LeCompte & Preissle (1993).
The method appears to have been first applied to the study of
educational sites in the 1950s. For two early examples of educational
ethnography, see Becker (1952) and Henry (1955).

The ethnographic approach to educational research has been referred to
using a variety of names: the humanistic approach (Walker & Evers,
1997), constructivist research (Magoon, 1977), naturalistic inquiry
(Lincoln & Guba, 1985), the symbolic approach (Popkewitz, 1984),
ethnographic research (Dobbert, 1982; LeCompte & Preissle, 1993; Taft,
1997; Wolcott, 1988), interpretive research (Carr & Kemmis, 1986;
Erickson, 1986), and qualitative research (Bogdan & Biklen, 1998;
Eisner, 1991; Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Martella, Nelson &
Marchand-Martella, 1999; Smith, 1983).

During the qualitative vs. quantitative debates of the 1980s,
ethnographic research underwent a name change and is now most commonly
referred to as *qualitative research*. This usage is unfortunate in
several respects. First, most of the research which is being published
as qualitative inquiry is, in fact, research which has used an
ethnographic or microethnographic research method and it would be more
appropriately referred to as such -- as is done by LeCompte & Preissle
(1993). Secondly, much of the research which is being published as
qualitative inquiry is research which is based upon an interpretive
theory of knowledge and it would be more appropriately referred to as
such -- as Erickson (1986) has argued. Thirdly, the great majority of
educational researchers continue to use the term *qualitative* in its
original sense, that is, to refer to a kind of *data* (non-numerical
data). Qualitative data is, of course, collected not only by
ethnographic and interpretivist researchers but also by social science
researchers and by behaviour analysts. Redefinition of the term
qualitative to refer to a research methodology may leave us with no term
which can be used to distinguish between qualitative and quantitative
data.

In order to avoid confusion, this book will follow current usage and
refer to the family of research methods which employ ethnographic
procedures as *qualitative research.* When we come to discuss the
research procedures used by qualitative researchers we will tend to
refer to these as *ethnographic procedures*. When we come to discuss
qualitative research which is based upon interpretive assumptions, we
will tend to refer to this research as *interpretive research*.

By 1995 about one-sixth of the published research into learning and
teaching was being undertaken using a qualitative methodology and about
one half of the published research into teaching was being undertaken
using a qualitative research methodology (Church, 1998).

**Definition.** Ethnographic research is research which aims primarily
to describe what is happening in a particular setting together with the
participant\'s perspectives on these events. This kind of research tends
to be broadly focused on all of the events which are occurring in a
particular setting (rather than on just one or two types of events). It
usually aims to provide a holistic picture of how a particular social
group (such as a classroom) operates, and to accomplish this by means of
direct observation and interviews with key participants. At the present
time, ethnographic research is most commonly referred to as qualitative
research. Ethnographic research which attempts to explain people's
behaviour in terms of the beliefs which people hold about their
behaviour is commonly referred to as interpretive research and this is
the most common kind of ethnographic research currently being undertaken
in classrooms.
