The idea of a natural science approach to the study of learning and
teaching dates from the late 19th century. The earliest studies of
learning and memory used simple counting procedures to describe the
effects of particular kinds of experience on behaviour and behaviour
change.

Perhaps the first investigator to experimentally isolate the sources of
variability in counts of behavior was Hermann Ebbinghaus (1850-1901). In
1885, Ebbinghaus began using numerical frequency of verbal recall as a
measure of strength of association or memory. . . . he invented a novel
experimental independent variable, the nonsense syllable and defined and
investigated the phenomena of learning and memory in terms of simple,
direct counting procedures (number of trials to completely learn a list,
number of items recalled as a function of the passage of time, etc.).
The extension of the natural science approach to measurement . . . has
its origins in the work of E.L. Thorndike (1898) who, in pursuing an
understanding of animal intelligence, arranged puzzles for animals to
solve and recorded both the time for solution and the number and nature
of unsuccessful attempts. . . . Probably the earliest and still among
the most elegant uses of instrumentation in the measurement of animal
behavior is in the work of Pavlov. . . . Three important features
characterize the work of Wundt, Thorndike, Ebbinghaus, and Pavlov and
place it squarely in the natural scientific tradition. First their units
of measurement were standard and absolute. . . . Second, all apparently
viewed variability as the scientific window through which to observe the
workings of basic controlling relationships. The third feature that
characterizes the work of these four investigators is their shared
tactic of collecting a large number of observations from each of a
relatively small number of subjects (Johnston & Pennypacker, 1993b, p.
34-35).

However, it was not until the mid 1960s that the first analyses of
learning in children, using a natural science methodology, began to
appear in the research literature (e.g., Allen, Hart, Buell, Harris &
Wolf, 1964; Hart, Allen, Buell, Harris & Wolf, 1964). These reports
marked the appearance, in the educational literature, of a completely
new kind of educational research - research which has come to be known
as behaviour analysis research. By 1995 approximately 17 per cent of the
empirical research into learning and teaching published in leading
educational psychology journals was research using a behaviour analysis
methodology (Church 1998). Brief histories of the development of
behaviour analysis will be found in Cooper, Heron & Heward (1987),
Johnston & Pennypacker (1993b), and Pierce & Epling (1995).

This new kind of research consists of a set of research methods (now
known as *behaviour analysis)*, a rapidly developing set of research
findings (usually referred to as *principles of behaviour)*, and a
unique philosophy of science (which behaviour analysts refer to as
*radical behaviourism*).

**Definition.** Natural science approaches to the study of learning and
teaching have the following characteristics. Investigations almost
always study behaviour change (that is, learning); change is measured by
making repeated observations of the learner\'s performance or
understanding over a number of days, weeks or months; behaviour change
is studied at the level of the individual; the primary aim of the
research enterprise is to identify classes of experience which are
consistently related to particular kinds of behaviour change; and this
aim is pursued using research procedures which are nearly always
experimental. The natural science approach which is most commonly used
to study learning and teaching is the approach which has come to be
known as behaviour analysis.
