The existence within education and psychology of two separate
experimental research paradigms raises important questions about how
best to set about the task of identifying the factors which facilitate
and hinder learning. It is these questions which are explored in the
sections which follow. For example, have certain approaches to research
proved to be more useful and productive than others? Do some research
procedures provide more accurate and reproducible measures of teaching
effects than others? Could any of the teaching and learning research
procedures which have been developed to date be said to be scientific?
