Some of the research into learning and teaching is narrative and
descriptive, some is normative and statistical, and some is experimental
and scientific. During the past 100 years, the fields in which knowledge
and technology have advanced most rapidly (e.g. public health) are those
where investigators have taken a scientific approach to their study of
their field and this implies that the field of learning and teaching
might advance most rapidly if it too focussed on the scientific research
into learning and teaching.

This is a position which is being taken by an increasing number of
learning and teaching researchers, it is the position which was taken by
the National Research Council Committee on Scientific Principles for
Educational Research which produced *Scientific Research in Education*
(National Research Council, 2002), it is the position taken by the What
Works clearing house in the US and the EPPI clearing house in the UK,
and it is the position taken by the US Congress during the passage of
the *No Child Left Behind* *Act* in the US -- legislation which requires
that only those methods and programmes which have been shown to be
effective by scientifically based research are to be included in school
reform programmes. Underlying each of these initiatives is the belief
that if teaching is to be considered a profession, "there should, at the
very least, be some commonly agreed notion of what the job actually
entails, a body of shared agreed knowledge of best practice which can
withstand critical scrutiny, a body of key skills learned to a high
level of competence if not mastery, and agreed criteria by which it can
readily be seen that progress toward completion of the job is being
made" (Wheldall, 2005, p. 583).

It needs to be clearly understood, however, that this view (that
teaching practice should be based on the results of scientific research)
remains controversial. In this section, therefore, we summarise this
debate and attempt to come to an appropriate conclusion. We then examine
the degree to which each of the main approaches to educational research
qualify as scientific. Thirdly, we develop a set of specification to
describe the methodological characteristics of the research studies
which are providing the most believable evidence about the conditions
necessary for different kinds of learning outcomes and the relative
effectiveness of various teaching practices.
