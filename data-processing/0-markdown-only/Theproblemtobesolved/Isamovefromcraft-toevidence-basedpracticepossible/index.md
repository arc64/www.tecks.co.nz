The suggestion that we should begin the transition from craft-based
teaching practices to evidence-based teaching practices rests on the
central assumption that there exists a tradition of scientific research
into learning and teaching together with a corpus of research findings
which are directly relevant to improving the effectiveness of current
classroom practice. Embedded in this assumption are two important
questions. First, is the scientific research into the conditions
necessary for learning sufficiently advanced to be used in guiding
design experiments aimed at the development of more effective teaching
procedures? Secondly, is the research on teaching sufficiently advanced
to enable the development of evaluation procedures which will enable
teachers to distinguish between effective and ineffective teaching
procedures and programmes?
