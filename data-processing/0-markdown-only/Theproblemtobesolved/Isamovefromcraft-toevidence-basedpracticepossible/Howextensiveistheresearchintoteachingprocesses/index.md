Given the advances, during the past 40 years, in the scientific study of
learning processes and the rapid development of our understanding of the
conditions necessary for the acquisition of different kinds of
competencies it is hardly surprising to find that there have also been
important developments in our understanding of teaching processes of
various kinds. As previously stated, a move to more effective,
evidence-based classroom teaching practices is only possible if the
evidence base has developed to the point where we can make reasonable
research-based predictions about what works to bring about particular
kinds of learning outcomes in particular groups of students. It is our
view that this is now the case for a number of different learning
outcomes.

**Research into maintaining the motivation of all children in diverse
classrooms**

Following identification of the variables upon which motivation depends,
researchers quickly began to develop a variety of management procedures
which work to motivate even the most poorly motivated learners (e.g.,
Martella, Nelson & Marchand-Martella, 2002; Sulzer-Azaroff & Mayer,
1991) In fact, there has been more scientific research into motivation
and behaviour management, during the past 35 years, than there has been
into any other aspect of classroom practice and we long ago discovered
that the children of teachers who have mastered these procedures learn
more (because they get more done) than the children of teachers who have
not mastered these procedures (e.g., Broughton & Lahey, 1978; Lovitt,
Guppy & Blattner, 1969). Teacher educators who are familiar with this
research continue to express amazement that this knowledge is not part
of the working knowledge of all classroom teachers and is not even part
of the curriculum of many teacher education programmes (e.g., Greenwood,
2001).

Sometimes classroom misbehaviour is symptomatic of development along an
antisocial (rather than a prosocial) trajectory. Here too researchers
have developed and demonstrated the effectiveness of a number of home
and school based interventions for halting antisocial development and
accelerating prosocial development -- at least in children up to the age
of about 9 years (Church, 2003).

**Research into the appropriate level of structure during instruction**

Well controlled studies of teaching processes (e.g. Church, 1976; Klahr
& Nigam, 2004; McCleery & Tindal, 1999) have discovered that loosely
structured teaching arrangements (such as discovery learning and
constructivist learning arrangements) result in lower levels of
understanding and slower rates of mastery for the great majority of
children than do more carefully structured teaching arrangements. (See
also Adams and Engelmann (1996), Chall (2002), Hermann (1969), and Mayer
(2004)). The results of controlled experimental research stand in stark
contrast to the beliefs of many classroom teachers and teacher educators
regarding the efficacy of discovery and "constructivist" learning
activities.

We have also discovered that co-operative learning activities can
facilitate learning but only if each child's learning is monitored and
there is some kind of incentive for group members to tutor each other in
an effective manner (Slavin, 1990). This is a major departure from the
way in which these procedures are currently used by the majority of
classroom teachers.

**Research into the conditions necessary for the development of new
understandings and the avoidance of misunderstandings**

We have identified the critical teaching conditions which must be
provided in order for children to master new understandings and have
developed procedures for explaining and teaching new concepts and rules
which are much more effective than the classroom procedures currently in
use (e.g., Church, 1999; Engelmann & Carnine, 1991; Muthukrishna,
Carnine, Grossen & Miller, 1993). Of particular importance is the
research into the relative efficiency of different kinds of explanations
and different kinds of example sequencing operations. This knowledge is
essential knowledge for anyone who is involved in subject matter
teaching or instructional design.

**Research into prompting procedures during the teaching of new skills
and operations**

Research has identified many of the critical teaching conditions which
must be provided in teaching new skills and this has stimulated the
development of prompting and scaffolding procedures (for teaching new
skills, procedures, and metacognitive skills) which are much more
effective than the ad hoc procedures currently used by classroom
teachers (e.g., Church, 1999; Pressley, Harris & Guthrie, 1992; Wolery,
Bailey & Sugai, 1988).

**Research into the teaching conditions necessary for long term
retention**

Following the discovery that level of fluency is the best predictor of
long term retention, researchers have developed procedures for measuring
fluency which are both accurate and simple enough for everyday classroom
use and they are making good progress in identifying the kinds of
practice procedures which are most effective in helping students achieve
a level of fluency sufficient to ensure that essential skills and
understandings are not forgotten (e.g., Binder, Haughton & Bateman,
2002; Church, 1999; Johnson & Layng, 1994). The results of the research
into fluency and fluency building, although essential for planning
effective teaching-practice cycles is almost completely unknown to the
majority of classroom teachers.

**Research into teaching programmes which are effective for all
children**

Following discovery of the key component skills which must be mastered
in order to learn to read we are making good progress in developing
reading teaching procedures which will ensure that all young children
master each of these skills and hence learn to read in a timely fashion
(Church, 2005; National Reading Panel, 2000). The best of the
scientifically developed reading programmes have a Year 2-3 failure rate
of less than 5%. In other words there are a number of reading programmes
which result in 95% of children learning to read in a timely fashion
rather than the 80% which currently occurs in New Zealand classrooms
(Church, 2005). Two of the most extensively evaluated reading programmes
(which have been shown to be effective for *all* children, including low
achieving children and children from impoverished environments) are the
Direct Instruction Reading programmes (Adams & Engelmann, 1996) and the
Success for All reading programme (Slavin & Madden, 2001).

**Research into accelerating progress through the curriculum**

Not only do the best of the scientifically derived teaching programmes
greatly reduce the number of children who fail, they also result in a
very considerable acceleration of the rate of progress of all children.
For example, there have been multiple demonstrations of the introduction
of scientifically designed teaching programmes being introduced to
entire schools with the result that the children in that school achieve,
on average, twice the national average rate of progress through the
early years of the school curriculum (e.g., Adams & Engelmann, 1996;
Johnson & Layng, 1994; Slavin & Madden, 2001).

By combining our emerging scientific knowledge of the various learning
processes in novel ways, scientifically oriented researchers have begun
to develop instructional systems which are considerably more effective
than anything previously reported in the educational research literature
(e.g. Heward, et al., 2004; Gardner et al., 1994; Moran & Malott, 2004).
In addition to the Direct Instruction programmes and the Success for All
programmes, these measurably superior teaching arrangements include
Greenwood's Classwide Peer Tutoring (e.g., Greenwood, Delquadri & Hall,
1989), Precision Teaching (Lindsley, 1991), Generative Instruction
(Johnson & Layng, 1994), the CABAS programme (Greer, 1994), decision
rule systems (e.g., Liberty & Haring, 1990; Fuchs, Fuchs & Hamlet,
1994), and mastery learning systems (e.g., Sherman, Ruskin & Semb,
1982). Each of these programmes has produced large and reproducible
gains in rate of learning across individual learners, across teachers,
and across time.

**Research into adapting instruction to prevent learning failures**

As a result of scientific research we have discovered how to track, from
lesson to lesson, the improvements in new skills and/or understandings
which are occurring during the course of instruction (e.g., Church,
1996; Deno & Fuchs, 1987; Shapiro, 1996) and we have discovered that the
children of teachers who have mastered these skills learn more (because
their teachers make better adaptive teaching decisions) than the
children of teachers who have not mastered these skills (e.g., Stecker &
Fuchs, 2000).

**The development of interventions which are effective in accelerating
the development of children with special teaching needs**

The 1998 issue of the *Journal of Clinical Child Psychology* which
reviewed the then current state of development in remedial treatments
for children with special needs showed that very considerable progress
had been made with respect to the design of effective treatments for
children with various types of disabilities. In that particular issue,
Kaslow and Thompson (1998) identified a number of effective
interventions for children and teenagers with depression, Ollendick and
King (1998) identified a number of effective treatments for children
with anxiety disorders, Brestan and Eyberg (1998) identified several
well-established treatments for children with disruptive and antisocial
behaviour difficulties, and Rogers (1998) reviewed the research into the
effectiveness of various teaching programmes for children with autism.
Not only were effective interventions identified for each of these
groups of children, many qualified as well established, and all had been
derived by behaviour analysts from basic scientific research into the
conditions responsible for the development of these types of
developmental problems.

Other reviewers have identified effective interventions for children
with intellectual disabilities (Snell, 1997), for children with
stuttering and other types of speech disorders (Gillon & Schwartz, 1998)
and have extended the findings of the 1998 reviews to identify effective
interventions for children with antisocial behaviour difficulties at
various age levels (Church, 2003).

**Research which demonstrates the possibility of scientifically oriented
research into classroom practice**

One of the most interesting by-products of all of this scientific
research into learning and teaching has been the repeated demonstration
that *classroom teachers* can function as researchers and can undertake
successful teaching evaluations and teaching experiments with children
in their own classrooms. This has become possible because of the
development of progress monitoring procedures and single case
experimental procedures which bring experimentation within the reach of
the classroom teacher (Church, 1975, 1996; Neuman & McCormick, 1995).
For the first time in the history of research on teaching it is now
possible for classroom teachers to move beyond qualitative "action
research" and to develop forms of practitioner research which are more
closely akin to the clinician research and experimentation which
characterises the more mature professions such as medicine.

Unlike previous forms of practitioner research which were largely
narrative and descriptive, the new practitioner research is experimental
and this creates considerable potential to stimulate improvements in
teaching practice. "Single subject methodology is well suited for
teacher research in schools since it can be situated in ongoing
instruction. . . This methodology provides practice-oriented ways for
field-based personnel to learn more about what is effective - and what
is not - in what they do" (Neuman & McCormick, 1995, p. 29).

Much the research reviewed in Book 4 and Book 5 of this site is research
which has been undertaken by practitioners. We have also set aside the
final volume (Book 9) to receive reports of practitioner research which
meet the inclusion criteria for this site.
