Much of the research into teaching demonstrates a relatively shallow
understanding of the complexities of classroom practice. Although the
aim of teaching is to foster learning, educational journals regularly
publish reports of, and PhDs are regularly awarded for, studies which
purport to be studies of teaching even although no data was ever
collected on the learning which occurred in each of the learners who
were exposed to that teaching.

With experience, many teachers come to recognise that classroom teaching
is an extremely complex activity (Alton-Lee, 2003; Church, 1999; Doyle,
1986; Engelmann & Carnine, 1991; Gersten, Baker, Pugatch, Scanlon &
Chard, 2001; Malouf & Schiller, 1995; Nuthall, 1999, 2007; Rosenshine &
Stevens, 1986; Wolery, Bailey & Sugai, 1987). The classroom teacher must
pursue dozens of teaching aims with dozens of learners simultaneously.
This task is infinitely more complex than the task facing, say, a
surgeon -- who has to work with only one patient at a time and who
always has at least a couple of assistants to help out with the work. We
may picture the complex task of classroom teaching in the manner shown
in Figure 1320.

In order to engage in effective teaching, the classroom teacher requires
a detailed knowledge of the way learning outcomes are affected by:

-   the school and classroom context,
-   the entering skills of the learner,
-   the developmental appropriateness of the learning activities
    provided,
-   the types of learning interactions which go to make up the learning
    activities,
-   the way in which these learning interactions and learning activities
    are sequenced,
-   the expertise of the agent supplying the guidance and feedback
    during these learning activities,
-   the appropriateness of the teaching and practice activities provided
    given the type of learning outcome aimed for,
-   the way in which student improvement is monitored over time and
-   the way in which the results of this monitoring are used to adapt
    teaching and practice activities for each student from day to day

As teachers become more experienced they gradually become aware of the
way in which these factors interact to determine the learning of
individual children within the classroom. The challenge for teacher
educators is how to hasten the development of this understanding in
prospective teachers and prospective teaching researchers. This
knowledge cannot be acquired by observing teachers at work because the
nature of teachers' work prevents most classroom teachers from attending
to many of these variables for much of the time. The notion that this
understanding can be acquired by watching teachers at work is one of the
enduring myths of teacher education.

We will know that teaching is beginning to move in the direction of
evidence-based practice when both teachers and teaching researchers
begin to abandon simplistic two-variable descriptions of teaching aims
and teaching practice (e.g. "I have found that following learning
activities can be used to teach *x*") and begin to operate in their
search for knowledge as if they are working in one small part of a
complex six-dimensional puzzle (e.g., "Which types of examples sequences
lead to the most accurate generalisations about *x* in 6-7 year old
children with little prior knowledge of *x* in classrooms where none of
the children know much about *x*?").
