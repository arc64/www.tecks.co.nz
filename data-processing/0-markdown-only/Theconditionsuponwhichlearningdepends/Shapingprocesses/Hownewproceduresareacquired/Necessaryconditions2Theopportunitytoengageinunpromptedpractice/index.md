The aim of procedural learning is to get to the stage where one can
perform the procedure independently, that is, without assistance. To
achieve this goal the learner must have the opportunity to engage in
unprompted practice. This means that, as the student acquires the
ability to perform parts of the procedure without error, the prompts for
those steps should be removed so that acquisition is not delayed (e.g.,
Chandler, Schuster & Stevens, 1993; Paine, Carnine, White, & Walters,
1982; Wolery, Ault, Gast & Doyle, 1990).
