The careful and explicit prompting of each of the steps in a procedure
results in quite rapid learning of new procedures. However, research has
identified a number of additional conditions which, although not
essential for learning, may function to accelerate the rate at which new
procedural skills are acquired.

**1. Whether the learner learns to describe the target behaviour**

Some writers have argued that new procedures can be learned more rapidly
if the learner first learns to describe (in order) the steps to be
performed (e.g., Montague & Bos, 1986) -- because the learner can then
self-prompt performance of each step in the correct order. The technical
name for this technique is *correspondence training.* It is also
referred to as *self-instruction.* There is little research evidence
demonstrating that this does, in fact happen.

**2. The extent to which troublesome components of the target skill are
identified for additional practice**

Sometimes particular steps in a procedure are more difficult to master
than others. If a particular step is proving difficult to master, faster
acquisition and mastery can often be achieved if the learner has the
opportunity for extra practice on the most difficult steps (e.g., Young,
West, Howard & Whitney, 1986).

Sometimes children want to learn new procedures although they are unable
to perform one or two of the steps in the procedure even when prompted.
For example, a child might want to learn how to find words in a
dictionary even though they cannot yet quickly recite the alphabet. The
current view is that it is more efficient to teach missing responses
separately, before introducing instruction on the procedure than to try
and shape the missing response while at the same time trying to teach
the new procedure. "Once that has been accomplished, the chain can be
developed more readily" (Sulzer-Azaroff & Mayer, 1991, p. 348). In the
dictionary skills example, it would almost certainly be more efficient
to bring the student to the point where they could recite the alphabet
starting from any point, *before* beginning to teach the student the
procedure for finding words in a dictionary.

**3. The type of practice schedule experienced**

Regular practice (e.g. daily practice) results in more rapid mastery of
new procedures than more widely spaced practices (Dempster & Farris,
1990). This is particularly true in cases where the teaching aim is to
develop a higher level of skill or fluency (Mayhall & Jenkins, 1977).
This is probably because more forgetting occurs between widely spaced
practices than between more closely spaced practices.
