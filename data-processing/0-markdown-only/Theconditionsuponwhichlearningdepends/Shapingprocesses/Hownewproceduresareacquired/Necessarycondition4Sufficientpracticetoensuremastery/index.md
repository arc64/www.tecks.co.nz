Where the student can already perform most of the steps which go to make
up the procedure, acquisition may be quite rapid (e.g., Joseph & Cooper,
1991; Rivera & Smith, 1987). Nevertheless, some practice will be
required in order to learn the sequence of steps and to learn to execute
the steps in a smooth fashion (e.g., Jones, Ollendick & Shinske, 1989;
Peterson, 1984; Yeaton & Bailey, 1983).

A new skill is not usually of much use until it can be performed with a
certain amount of speed or fluency. We would not say that a student had
mastered the long multiplication procedure if he or she still needed
three minutes to work a problem which most students can work in one
minute. At the end of the acquisition phase the learner will be able to
perform the entire procedure without prompting, but the performance may
be slow and hesitant. To build fluency, a time limit should be set,
further practice opportunities provided, and performances which are both
correct and within the time limit differentially reinforced (e.g.,
Young, West, Howard, & Whitney, 1986).

Practice should take place in those situations and under those
conditions where the procedure will need to be used (e.g., Yeaton &
Bailey, 1983). If the student is able to perform the procedure but is
unsure as to when it should be used, some generalisation training will
need to be provided (e.g., Lloyd, Saltzman & Kauffman, 1981). This is
true not only for specific academic procedures such as solving
particular classes of maths problems but also for metacognitive
procedures. "Good \[metacognitive\] strategy instruction involves
substantial teaching and practice over a long period of time and across
multiple tasks. This provides . . . ample opportunities for students to
discover when and where to use particular strategies and to adapt these
procedures to new situations" (Borkowski & Muthukrishna, 1992, p. 491).
