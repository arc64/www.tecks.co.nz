The only condition which has been demonstrated to be necessary for the
acquisition of meaning is the repeated contiguous occurrence of the
conditioned eliciting stimulus (which already elicits the visual image
or meaning response) and the unconditioned eliciting stimulus (the word
or symbol which initially has no meaning) (Staats, 1968; Staats, Staats,
Finley & Minke, 1953; Staats, Staats, Heard & Nims, 1959; Staats &
Staats, 1957). There may well be other necessary conditions, such as the
form or intensity of the meaning elicited by the meaningful stimulus,
but the effects of variables such as these have yet to be measured.
