In order for a dysfunctional anxiety reaction to extinguish, we have to
arrange for repeated exposure to the anxiety eliciting situation or
situations. However, this is not easy because whenever an unrealistic
fear is acquired, a number of avoidance responses are always acquired at
the same time. It is these avoidance responses which prevent extinction
from occurring naturally. Furthermore, the avoidance responses may be
quite well practised and may well be occurring without much conscious
thought. This makes treatment of the phobia difficult. It may be quite
difficult to persuade someone who is scared of dogs, or school, or maths
to put themselves in a situation where they have repeatedly to approach
the very thing that they are scared of. "Avoidance behaviour is critical
in therapy because as long as one can successfully avoid an
anxiety-eliciting situation, there is no opportunity for the extinction
of conditioned anxiety to occur. Someone who has acquired a fear of
riding in elevators/lifts usually will not enter one. While this
prevents fear arousal it also prevents its extinction" (Reese, 1978, p.
185).

The relative effectiveness of different procedures for extinguishing
unrealistic fears and anxieties is a topic which has been the subject of
considerable research (e.g. Misra & Schloss, 1989; Ollendick & King,
1998). The most effective and commonly used respondent extinction
procedure is *systematic desensitisation*. A desensitisation programme
has three elements:

1\. Repeated exposure to the anxiety eliciting stimulus or situation

2\. A graded series of exposures from the least to the most fearful
stimulus situation

3\. Strong reinforcement for approach responses, that is, strong
reinforcement for continued practice in the face of the anxiety
eliciting stimulus or situation.

The extinction of a dysfunctional anxiety reaction may be undertaken
either in vivo or imaginally. In vivo desensitization involves repeated
exposure to real life examples of the feared situations/stimuli in the
absence of any actual danger. With in vivo exposure, extinction proceeds
more rapidly than it does with imaginal desensitization. However, there
are certain fearsome situations (such as flying) which cannot be cheaply
and easily reproduced for the purposes of desensitization.

Imaginal desensitization involves the repeated bringing to mind of the
feared situations/ stimuli. This procedure may be used to good effect
with older children who have a good imagination but cannot be used with
younger children who have difficulty imagining themselves in the feared
situation.

In addition, the treatment of dysfunctional anxiety reactions almost
always involves an additional element designed to control or manage
avoidance responses. The most commonly used procedures for managing
avoidance responses are (a) the use of graduated exposure, (b) prompting
the fearful child to engage in a response which is incompatible with
feeling anxious or (c) the reinforcement of approach responses.

1\. *Graduated exposure.* Graduated exposure involves the gradual
exposure to a sequence of fearful situations or a sequence of fearful
visualisations graded from least to most fearsome. Repeated exposure is
necessary in order to extinguish the conditioned emotion eliciting
properties of the feared stimulus or situation and graduated exposure
allows the learner to experience success from the outset by making each
step small and easy to achieve. Stableford (1979), for example,
extinguished a fear of loud noises in a 3-year old girl who had
developed a fear of loud noises by introducing the noises, first at a
distance and then at distances which were increasingly closer to the
child. Luiselli (1978) cured a child\'s fear of riding in a school bus
by gradually increasing the time spent sitting, first in a stationary
bus, and then while travelling in a bus. Menzies and Clarke (1993) cured
a number of cases of swimming pool phobia by moving fearful children
progressively closer to the pool and then further and further into the
water.

The steps to be achieved during a programme of graduated exposure are
often referred to as a *fear hierarchy.* Let us say, for example, that
earlier experiences have resulted in a child who feels so anxious when
asked to speak in front of the class that they are unable to do so. The
development of a desensitisation programme to help the child overcome
this fear would begin with the construction of a fear hierarchy which
lists the anxiety producing situations in a graded order from the least
to the most anxiety provoking. The task of getting the anxiety provoking
situations in graded order is accomplished by asking the child to put
the feared situations in order from "easiest" to "most difficult". The
fear hierarchy might look something like this:

1.Reading to the teacher alone

2.Reading to two other students alone

3.Reading to a group of six students

4.Reading to a group of 12 students

5.Reading to the whole class

6.Describing a recent experience to the teacher alone

7.Describing a recent experience to two other students alone

8.Describing a recent experience to a group of six students

9.Describing a recent experience to a group of 12 students

10.Describing a recent experience to the whole class

Desensitisation begins with practice at the first step. In our
illustrative example, the child would be provided with opportunities to
read to the teacher and would receive strong social or tangible
reinforcement for doing so. When the child can do this without anxiety,
the child moves on to practise at the second step. If each step in the
hierarchy involves a relatively small increase in "difficulty", the
fearful student should be able to move from one step to the next after
about two to four experiences at each step. Gradually the child works
his or her way up the hierarchy until, in this case, the child can talk
in front of the entire class without experiencing disabling levels of
anxiety.

2\. *Engaging in an incompatible response.* Having the child engage in
behaviour which is incompatible with anxiety can also reduce avoidance
responding. The most commonly used incompatible behaviour is deep muscle
relaxation but other incompatible behaviours such as strenuous activity,
or enjoyable activities, can also be used to good effect (e.g. Croghan &
Musante, 1975).

3\. *Reinforcing approach responses.* The most commonly used procedure
for controlling avoidance responses is to provide strong reinforcement
for approach responses. Reinforcement may be made contingent upon each
step which the child takes towards the feared situation, or it may be
made contingent on approaches to increasingly fearsome situations, or it
may be made contingent upon engaging in those behaviours which the child
has been avoiding (e.g. Luiselli, 1978). Reinforcement for approach
responses provides the motivation for the learner to continue with the
programme even although he/or she continues to experience some anxiety
at each new step. Reinforcers must be sufficiently powerful to outweigh
the effects of the anxiety produced by approach behaviours if they are
to have any effect in strengthening approach responses.

The effectiveness of systematic desensitization procedures in the
treatment of specific phobias has been known since the 1950s (Wolpe,
1958). Joseph Wolpe's first book (Wolpe, 1958) described the results of
his treatment of 249 patients and reported a 98 per cent success rate
with only a 2 per cent relapse rate.

Research into the treatment of anxiety reactions indicates that almost
all of the simpler fears can be effectively treated using the
desensitisation procedure (Davey, 1997; Vasey & Dadds, 2001). Generally
speaking, a set of 20 to 40 graded practice sessions is all that is
required to assist someone to overcome a simple fear such as a fear of a
specific setting or task.
