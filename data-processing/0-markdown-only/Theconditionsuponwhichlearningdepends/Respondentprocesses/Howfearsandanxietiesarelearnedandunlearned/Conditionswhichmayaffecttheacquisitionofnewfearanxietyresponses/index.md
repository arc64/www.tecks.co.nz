There will be a number of conditions which affect the speed with which
particular conditioned anxiety reactions are acquired by individual
learners. For example, it is usually argued that a particularly
traumatic experience can establish a conditioned fear response to the
situation in which the trauma occurred as a result of a single
experience.

Respondent conditioning is most likely to occur in situations where the
neutral stimulus occurs *just before* the unconditioned eliciting
stimulus, signalling to the learner that the unconditioned eliciting
stimulus is about to occur. Respondent conditioning occurs most rapidly
in situations where the neutral stimulus *regularly precedes* the
unconditioned eliciting stimulus, that is, in situations where the
learner can reliably predict that the unconditioned eliciting stimulus
may follow. It is to be expected that this will also be the case during
the acquisition of conditioned anxiety and fear responses.

However, apart from a few demonstration experiments (e.g. Watson &
Rayner, 1920), research into the conditions which govern the rate of
acquisition of unrealistic fears is fairly minimal. This is because it
is not possible to get Human Ethics approval for programmes of research
which involve frightening children out of their wits in order to see
whether different kinds of frightening experiences have different
effects on the rate of acquisition of unrealistic fears.
