In some classrooms (and families) teachers (and parents) attempt to
maintain the motivation to complete classroom (and household) tasks
using negative reinforcement contingencies. In these situations, the
level of motivation to complete particular tasks will be directly
related to the extent to which compliance has been successful in
avoiding punishment (or more successful than alternative responses in
avoiding punishment) in the past. Experimental demonstrations of the use
of negative reinforcement to increase or maintain motivation or
productivity in the classroom are rare and those that have been
undertaken tend to show that positive reinforcement and negative
reinforcement contingencies have similar effects on effort (e.g.
Broughton & Lahey, 1978; Leach & Tan, 1996). However, as motivators,
negative reinforcement contingencies have an important unwanted side
effect and that is they often result in a decreased liking for both the
task and the teacher (Morris & Redd, 1975).

One of the ways of avoiding the negative effects on liking for the task
is to combine positive and negative reinforcement contingencies so that
task completion earns part of a reward while failure to complete the
task loses part of a reward. This type of differential reinforcement
contingency can have an even stronger motivating effect than the
reinforcement contingency on its own (Kelley & McCain, 1995; McLaughlin
& Malaby, 1974; Morris & Redd, 1975; Pfiffner & O'Leary, 1987).
