In the previous section we identified the conditions which appear to be
necessary for the acquisition of completely new behaviours, motor
skills, procedures, and other types performances (including speech). In
addition to acquiring a wide variety of performance skills, human
learners also acquire a wide variety of verbal and conceptual behaviours
and skills.

Just as we distinguished between two major types of performance learning
outcomes (the acquisition of new behaviours and the acquisition of new
procedures) so we must distinguish between several types of verbal and
conceptual learning outcomes.

The first of these, the acquisition of equivalence relations described
in Section 1, covers the case where there is a stimulus-response
relationship to be learned and there is a one-to-one correspondence
between the stimulus and the correct response.

The second of these, the acquisition of generalised correct responding
described in Section 2, covers the case where the learner has to learn
to respond correctly to a class of stimuli or events and where there is
but a single response which is conventionally considered to be correct.

The third case, the acquisition of new knowledge responses described in
Section 3, covers the case where the stimulus can take a variety of
forms and correct responses can take a variety of forms also. These
three types of learning outcomes must always be distinguished during
both teaching and research because the conditions which are necessary
for acquisition differ in each of the three cases.
