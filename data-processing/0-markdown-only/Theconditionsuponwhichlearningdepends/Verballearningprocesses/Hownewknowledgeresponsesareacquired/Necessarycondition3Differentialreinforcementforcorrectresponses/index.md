Having established that knowledge responses must be practised, it seems
reasonable to assume that these practice responses will need to be
differentially reinforced if they are to be remembered. The sources of
reinforcement which operate during knowledge learning have been little
studied and remain a matter of some conjecture. The enthusiasm with
which many children discuss their discoveries about the world suggests
that simply making these discoveries may be reinforcing for many
students. Most students are motivated to respond correctly to lesson
questions and test questions which suggests that "being correct" is
reinforcing for most students while "being wrong" is not. Primary age
children also tend to work hard to avoid the embarrassment of negative
evaluations by teachers and/or peers and this suggests that negative
reinforcement processes provide some motivation for completing classroom
tasks to the standard set by the teacher (e.g., McLaughlin, 1992;
Stowitschek, Hecimovic, Stowitschek, & Shores, 1982).

What seems to be critical is the feedback which enables the learner to
distinguish between correct and incorrect responses. While a number of
experiments have shown that feedback affects recall following knowledge
learning tasks (e.g. Anderson, Kulhavy & Andre, 1971), the question of
whether or not this feedback is a necessary condition for knowledge
acquisition has yet to be demonstrated empirically.

What little research there is suggests that the confirmation of correct
responses seems to be less important than the identification and
correction of errors (Hancock, Stock & Kulhavy, 1992; Kulhavy, Yekovich
& Dyer, 1976). It is not yet clearly understood why the confirmation of
correct responses to knowledge testing questions has so little effect on
knowledge learning. Perhaps it is because that, if the question is a
meaningful one, learners can in most cases recognise that they have
responded correctly.

What does seem to be important during the learning of new knowledge is
that errors should be corrected when they occur. Carnine (1977) studied
the effects of error correction in an experimental analysis of learning
during arithmetic lessons. "When the teacher corrected errors, the
children said the right answer about 70 per cent of the time during
training and 65 per cent of the time during post-test. When the teacher
ignored errors, the child said the right answer about 15 per cent of the
time during training and 15 per cent during post-test" (Carnine, 1977,
p. 177).

Errors which are not self-corrected indicate (a) that the correct
response has not yet been acquired and (b) that the student may be
unaware that he or she has made an error. It follows therefore that,
unless errors are corrected, the wrong knowledge response may be
acquired.

Of course, errors can only be identified and corrected if the learners
are engaging in overt practice responses or overt activities at least
initially. Once an error has occurred it is more effective to provide a
prompt followed by a second opportunity to respond (rather than a
correction on its own) (Drevno, Kimball, Possi, Heward, Gardner, &
Barbetta, 1994).

The rule that errors should not be left uncorrected is especially
important during any progress tests which are scheduled during the
course of instruction. Progress tests serve not only to identify items
of information which have not yet been acquired but also provide an
additional practice opportunity with respect to each of the items of
information included in the test. It is essential, therefore, that the
learner's responses be marked, and errors corrected, immediately
following the test. In the classroom, this can be accomplished using
peer marking or self marking from an answer key.
