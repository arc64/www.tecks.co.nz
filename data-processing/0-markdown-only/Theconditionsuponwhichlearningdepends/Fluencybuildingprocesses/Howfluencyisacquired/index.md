The change from correct but slow responding (acquisition) to correct and
fast responding (mastery) requires additional practice. It may require a
considerable amount of practice. In this site we will refer to teaching
activities which aim to build increased fluency as *fluency building*
activities. This chapter describes the teaching procedures which have
been found to be most effective during the fluency building phase of
instruction. In order to build fluency, the teacher must provide
practice tasks on which improvements in speed are possible. In addition,
improvements in accuracy rate must be reinforced. This, in turn,
requires that the teacher have some way of determining when an increase
in accuracy rate has occurred.
