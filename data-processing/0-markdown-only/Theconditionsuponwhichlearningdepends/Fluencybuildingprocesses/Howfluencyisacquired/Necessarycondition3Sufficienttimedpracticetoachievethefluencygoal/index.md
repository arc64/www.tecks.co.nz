Fluency development is primarily a function of additional practice. This
practice needs to continue until the fluency goal is reached. A
considerable amount of research has been undertaken into the fluency
levels which predict long term retention. Most of this research has been
undertaken by teachers and researchers working within the domain of
Precision Teaching. Reviews of the results of the Precision Teaching
research will be found in Binder (1993, 1996), Binder, Haughton and
Bateman (2002), Binder and Watkins (1990), Kubina and Morrison (2000)
and Lindsley (1992).

Research based lists of the fluency levels which have been found to
predict long term retention have been provided by a number of authors
(e.g., Binder et al., 2002; Freeman & Haughton, 1993a, 1993b; Haring,
Liberty & White, 1981; Hasbrouck & Tindal, 1992; Haughton, 1980; Howell
& Lorson-Howell, 1990; Koorland, Keel & Ueberhorst, 1990; Mercer, Mercer
& Evans, 1982). Figure 4513 provides a summary of the research-based
fluency levels which are currently being used to define mastery with
respect to selected basic skills.

Where the skill which is to be mastered is one which is going to be used
every day, (as is the case with most everyday skills such as dressing,
cooking, driving and so on), these additional practice opportunities
will occur as the learner sets about his or her daily activities. An
example of the amount of additional practice which is necessary to bring
a skill such as getting dressed to fluency will be found in Young, West,
Howard & Whitney (1986).

Where the learning task involves the mastery of new equivalence
relations, the amount of practice which is required to build fluency may
be considerable. "The number of trials needed by nine first and second
graders with learning problems to reach 30 digits correct per minute
with two or fewer errors on subtraction facts 0 to 9 ranged from 632 to
1,168 with a mean of 840" (Mercer & Miller, 1992, p. 32). Silbert,
Carnine & Stein (1981, p. 248) report that primary school learners take,
on average, twenty, 8-minute sessions (160 minutes) to achieve fluency
on one set of nine facts (e.g. 1 + 4, 2 + 4, 3 + 4, 4 + 4, 5 + 4, 6 + 4,
7 + 4, 8Â + 4, 9 + 4).

In the great majority of cases, fluency building activities will need to
be generated by the teacher. An analysis of the practice exercises
provided in textbooks indicates that the great majority of textbooks do
not contain sufficient practice exercises to build fluency. Early
reading texts do not contain sufficient reading to build fluency in
reading (Church & Martin, 1992), early maths textbooks do not contain
sufficient exercises to build fluency in basic maths skills (Silbert,
Carnine & Stein, 1981), and spelling textbooks do not contain sufficient
exercises to build fluency in spelling (Brown, 1990).
