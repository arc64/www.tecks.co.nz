Measurement is one of the cornerstones of the research activity.
Measurement involves the "quantification of observations with respect to
a reference scale defined by units that are both absolute and standard"
(Johnston & Pennypacker, 1993b, p. 21). The great majority of the
measurement scales in common use are absolute and standard scales.
Following Stevens (1951), such scales are usually referred to as *ratio
scales.* Following Johnston and Pennypacker (1993a), they are also
referred to as *idemnotic measures.* Idemnotic measures have the
following characteristics:

-   The scale exists independently of the things which are being
    measured (as a measure of length, a tape measure exists
    independently of the particular lengths being measured and, as a
    measure of time, a clock exists independently of the particular time
    which is being measured).
-   The scale is divided into units which have a name (e.g. centimetre
    as a unit of length, or minute as a unit of time).
-   The scales are equal interval scales (the distance between each cm
    mark on a tape measure is the same, and the length of time between
    each minute mark on a clock is the same).
-   The scales have a true zero point (a length of zero cm is, in
    principle, possible, as is an elapsed time of zero minutes).
-   The scales have been standardised so that a length of, say, 10 cm is
    always the same length, and an interval of 10 minutes is always the
    same interval, regardless of what is being measured, who is doing
    the measurement, and the particular clock or timer which is being
    used.

"In the social sciences measurement scales very seldom have either zero
points or equal units" (Maddox, 1993, p. 74-75). The numbers "1" to "5"
on an attitude scale have no meaning as absolute units. There is no
answer the question "One what?" The zero value (no preference) on a five
point scale is usually "3", not "0". And the value of "1" changes each
time the question changes. Intelligence tests, achievement tests, and so
on, are not standard and absolute scales. If a child has an IQ of 100,
there is no answer to the question "100 what?" An improvement from 100
to 110 on an intelligence test is an improvement of quite a different
magnitude to an improvement from 170 to 180. And the scores on an
intelligence test do not refer to any absolute measure of ability. IQ
scales are developed by the repeated application of the measuring
instrument (the IQ test) to a sample of subjects and simply reflect the
variability in that sample. If the population average or the population
variability changes, the scores take on entirely new meanings. A score
of 100 on the XYZ intelligence test normed in 1960 (when 100 was the
average) is not the same as a score of 100 on the XYZ test in 1990 (when
the average had become 110).

In the social sciences, persons and events are most commonly ranked on
ordinal scales in which a person\'s score represents their position
relative to the average score obtained by some sample of persons.
Johnston and Pennypacker (1993a) have coined the term *vaganotic* to
refer to measurement scales where the scale units are defined in terms
of the distribution of scores on the measuring instrument itself (rather
than by reference to an independently defined unit). Some examples of
vaganotic and idemnotic measures of performance are shown in Table 3234.

One of the questions which has yet to be resolved by educational
researchers is the question of when it is appropriate to use vaganotic
measures and when it is appropriate to use idemnotic measures of human
performance and learning. All of the early learning researchers
including Ebbinghaus, E.L. Thorndike and Pavlov used standard and
absolute scales (idemnotic scales) to measure the phenomena they were
studying and behaviour analysts continue to use idemnotic measures such
as counts, measures of time, and counts per unit of time. "The use of
procedures wherein the phenomena being measured or the units of
measurement are defined in terms of \[the\] variability characterizing a
set of otherwise direct observations seem peculiar to the social
sciences" (Johnston & Pennypacker, 1993b, p. 29).

Idemnotic measures have a characteristic which vaganotic measures do not
possess. The results of an idemnotic measure are directly comparable
from one phase to the next within an investigation and from one
investigation to another. This allows the community of researchers who
are using that measure to share their data, compare their findings, and
develop a common theory. In addition, the results of idemnotic
measurement are much more believable than the results of vaganotic
measurement.

The question of when to use vaganotic and when to use idemnotic
measuring procedures is a particularly important question for
educational researchers. Although vaganotic measures are much more
widely used in the study of learning and teaching than are idemnotic
measures, the view has been expressed that the scientific study of
learning was seriously subverted by the move to vaganotic measurement
and that the scientific study of learning will again become possible
only when learning researchers return to the use of idemnotic measures
of change (Chiesa, 1994; Johnston & Pennypacker, 1993b).
