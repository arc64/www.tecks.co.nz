The task of teaching new concepts and generalisations is simplified by
virtue of the fact that human beings appear to have an in-built ability
to detect and to respond to samenesses in the world around them
(Carnine, 1990). This means that new concepts and principles can often
be taught using a relatively small number of examples and non-examples.

Research into concept learning is extensive. However, most of this
research involves older adolescent or adult learners and learning tasks
in which the definition of the concept is withheld so that the
investigator can study the processes which are involved in deriving an
unknown classification rule from different sequences of examples (e.g.
Bourne, 1966). Given that it is good teaching practice to begin
instruction with the definition of new concepts, most of the research on
concept formation is largely irrelevant to the question of how best to
teach new concepts to younger learners.
