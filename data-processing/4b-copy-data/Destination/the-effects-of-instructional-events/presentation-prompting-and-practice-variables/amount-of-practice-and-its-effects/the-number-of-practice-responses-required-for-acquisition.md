The experiments cited in the preceding section show that increasing
student engagement in a lesson by requiring a response to every question
increases student retention of lesson content but the experiments do not
tell us how many practice responses are required in order to ensure
acquisition or retention. As teaching researchers begin to identify the
important questions which need to be addressed, investigators are
beginning to track the number of practice responses which are actually
required in order to learn and remember a new response. One of the
startling findings which has emerged from the research so far is the
discovery that the human brain can learn and remember meaningful
propositions with rather fewer response opportunities than was
previously thought.

McLay (2003) found that normally developing four year olds required
three practice opportunities per name, on average, to learn and remember
the names of 20 model animals and that this was the case regardless of
whether learning opportunities were child initiated or experimenter
initiated. Keel and Gast (1992) report that three learning disabled
11-year olds required an average of 3 trials per word in order to learn
to recognise the words in sets of 15 unknown sight words.

As part of his PhD investigations, McWilliams (2005) found that 6- to
7-year olds required, on average, five practice responses in order to
learn and remember a correct spelling response for 24 hours. The words
were words which commonly occur in written prose and which the child
could not yet spell. The five practice responses figure was quite stable
across a variety of prompting and error correction procedures and, in
the majority of cases, occurred over a two- to three-day period. Nulman
and Gerber (1984) also found that an 8-year old student with learning
disabilities required five trials per word in order to learn and
remember the words in a set of 10 unknown spelling words.

Based on extensive analyses of everything which individual children say
and do during the course of samples of social studies lessons, Nuthall
and Alton Lee have concluded from their descriptive study that 10- to
11-year old children learn and remember only those items of information
which they have experienced on at least four occasions with no more than
two days between any two of the four experiences (Nuthall, 1999; Nuthall
& Alton-Lee, 1993). It appears that the experience has to be with the
complete proposition although experience with definitions, analogies,
examples and non-examples can suffice provided that the pupil also
experiences the complete proposition on one or more occasions. The
\"four experiences with no more than two days between each\" rule has
identified, with 82 to 85 per cent accuracy, the previously unknown
items of information which individual children have learned and
remembered across half a dozen separate lesson samples.
