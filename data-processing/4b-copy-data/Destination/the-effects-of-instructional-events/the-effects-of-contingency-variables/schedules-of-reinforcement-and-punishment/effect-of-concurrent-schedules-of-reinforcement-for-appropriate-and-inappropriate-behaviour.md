There are many occasions when people find themselves in a situation
where there are several different actions which can be taken to achieve
a particular goal. In this kind of situation the various actions which
can be taken are said to be on *concurrent schedules* of reinforcement.
This is one of the situations where we say that the individual "has a
choice."

How are choices made in this kind of situation? The basic research into
this question indicates that responses in this situation are distributed
according to what Richard Herrnstein refers to as the *Matching Law*
(Herrnstein, 1961). "The matching law states that an individual will
distribute his or her behavior between alternatives in the same ratio
that reinforcements have been obtained for these alternatives" (Myerson
& Hale, 1984, p. 367). A considerable amount of basic research supports
the view that the matching law describes a fundamental learning process
within the mammalian brain (Myerson & Hale, 1984). The learner uses past
experience to choose the behaviour which is most likely to generate
reinforcement (or likely to generate the most reinforcement) in the
current situation.

The Matching Law provides a powerful source of guidance any teacher (or
parent) who is faced with a child who engages in high rates of
non-compliant, inappropriate, or antisocial behaviour. This pattern of
behaviour indicates that the learning history of the misbehaving child
is one in which both prosocial and antisocial responses have worked to
get the child what he/she wants, that is, both have been reinforced, in
the past. That this is so is confirmed by observational studies of the
home life of children who engage in elevated rates of tantrums. These
studies have repeatedly found that, for these children, tantrums work
just as well as pro-social responses to get them what they want
(Patterson, 1982; Church, 2003).

That Matching Law predicts that a misbehaving child will continue to
misbehave until the child discovers that appropriate behaviour generates
more reinforcement than inappropriate behaviour and many experiments
have demonstrated that this is the case. When parents (or teachers)
succeed in their attempts to ensure that prosocial behaviours generate
more attention and more reinforcement than antisocial behaviours, the
misbehaving child almost immediately switches to prosocial modes of
behaviour in all situations where the new contingencies are operating
(Ayllon, Garber & Pisor, 1975; Baer, Rowbury & Baer, 1973; Blue, Madsen
& Heimberg, 1981; Coleman, 1973; Ducharme & DiAdamo, 2005; Goetz,
Homberg & LeBlanc, 1975; Houlihan & Jones, 1990; Kern, Ringdahl, Hilt &
Sterling-Turner, 2001; Lalli, Browder, Mace & Brown, 1993; Libb, Sachs &
Boyd, 1973; McGoey & DuPaul, 2000; Stephens, Wacker, Cooper, Richman &
Kayser, 2003; Witt, Hannafin & Martens, 1983; Workman, Kindall &
Williams, 1980).

An understanding of the effects of the Matching Law on motivation and
behaviour is essential for anyone who is involved in behaviour
management or the design of remedial interventions for inappropriate
behaviour. This is because, while interventions in which desirable
behaviour is reinforced on a richer schedule than inappropriate
behaviour will motivate a complete cessation of the inappropriate
behaviour, the reverse is also true. *Interventions which fail to
achieve this goal will invariably be found to be completely ineffective*
(Myerson & Hale, 1984).

It is important to note also that it is possible for incorrect academic
responses to generate reinforcement in the classroom. In a classic study
by Hasazi and Hasazi (1972), a child who appeared to be having
difficulty in mastering simple computational processes was receiving
individualised tuition by the teacher each day on the problems which had
been incorrectly answered. When this individualised tuition was
withdrawn, the student\'s accuracy on a daily maths work sheets climbed
from about 20 per cent correct to 100 per cent correct within a few
days. The experiment demonstrated that, by providing individualised
assistance, the teacher had mistakenly been providing more reinforcement
for error responses than for correct responses.
