The aim of any teaching sequence is always to produce independent
performance in the learner. Similarly, the aim of any procedure designed
to improve self-regulation is always to produce a level of
self-regulation such that programmed punishment contingencies are no
longer required. In both of these cases, the task facing the teacher is
that of moving from the continuous or frequently occurring contingencies
of marking/checking and consequential reinforcement and correction to
the intermittent (and infrequent) schedules of naturally occurring
consequences which typically operate in the classroom. How is this to be
achieved? It is usually argued that the transfer from frequent
reinforcement to intermittent reinforcement should be gradual, that is,
that the schedule should be gradually thinned. Good levels of
maintenance following the gradual thinning of programmed contingencies
of reinforcement has been demonstrated for a number of learning outcomes
in a variety of classroom settings (Bailey, Wolf & Phillips, 1970;
Christensen, Young & Marchant, 2004; Fry & Thomas, 1976; Hagopian,
Contrucci Kuhn, Long & Rush, 2005; McNaughton, 1975).

Having demonstrated that new levels of skill and of self-regulation can
be maintained, and extinction avoided, when programmed contingencies of
reinforcement (and punishment) are gradually thinned, researchers now
need to turn their attention to identifying the conditions which must be
present in order for this effect to occur. Is it dependent upon the
level of mastery or fluency which has been achieved, for example? How
rapidly can the schedule be thinned while still achieving maintenance,
and so on?
