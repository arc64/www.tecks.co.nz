Some schools provide a more positive and supportive working environment
than others. It seems safe to assume that a positive school climate will
support higher levels of teacher motivation, enthusiasm and effort than
a negative climate. School climate variables have never been adequately
defined and procedures for measuring them have yet to be devised.
