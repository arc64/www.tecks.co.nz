When an individual learns, both their nervous system and their behaviour
changes. However, it is on the basis of observed changes in what the
learner can say and do (their behaviour) and not on the basis of changes
in at the synaptic level that we make the decision as to whether or not
someone has learned something. We conclude that someone has become more
motivated if we see them behaving in a more motivated way. We conclude
that someone has learned a new skill if we see them doing something
which they were previously unable to do. We conclude that someone has
acquired a new understanding if they are now able to explain something
which previously they could not explain.

Note that learning researchers use the word "behaviour" to refer to
anything which the learner does, or says, or writes, or thinks or feels.
The term is not limited just to physical actions. Any procedure which we
use to study learning must therefore be one which is capable of tracking
changes in the behaviour (that is verbal and non-verbal actions and
interactions) of individual learners over time. Because changes in
behaviour are publicly observable, or can be made publicly observable
(e.g. by asking the learner to think out loud), changes in behaviour can
almost always be observed directly or recorded on video for later
analysis.
