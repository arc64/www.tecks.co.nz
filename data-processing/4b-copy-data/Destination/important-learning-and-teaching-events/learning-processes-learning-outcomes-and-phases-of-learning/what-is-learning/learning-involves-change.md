Learning involves a change in learner competence, ability,
understanding, attitude, belief, or whatever. Change is something which
occurs over time. A child who is learning to talk is a child whose
ability to talk is changing (improving) with the passage of time. A
child who is learning to read is a child whose reading skills are
changing (improving) over time.

So time is an integral component of learning as a subject matter and any
procedure which we use to study learning must, therefore, be a procedure
which is capable of tracking changes in learner competence over time.
Experience suggests that repeated observation provides the best
description of change and rate of change.
