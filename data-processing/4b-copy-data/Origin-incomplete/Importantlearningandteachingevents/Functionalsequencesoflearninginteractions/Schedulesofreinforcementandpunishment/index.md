Most behaviours are engaged in repeatedly over time. Sometimes a
particular response is successful and generates reinforcement and
sometimes it does not. A student who seeks help in the classroom will
find that help seeking sometimes works and sometimes does not. In other
words, not all instances of a particular response generate
reinforcement. This is particularly true during the childhood years
where much activity involves attempts to acquire and to master new
responses and skills.

When a particular behaviour sometimes generates reinforcement (or
succeeds in avoiding punishment) and sometimes does not, we refer to the
ratio of reinforced to non-reinforced responses as the *schedule of
reinforcement* for that response. The term schedule of reinforcement can
refer to either a schedule of positive reinforcement or a schedule of
negative reinforcement. It is also possible to have schedules of
punishment. In this case the term schedule refers to the ratio of
punished to non-punished responses.

Schedules of reinforcement (and punishment) may vary with respect to
frequency of reinforcement (or punishment), predictability, and type --
whether response based or time based -- as shown in the following table.

The distinctions in the preceding table are important because different
schedules of reinforcement have different effects on motivation and
learning.
