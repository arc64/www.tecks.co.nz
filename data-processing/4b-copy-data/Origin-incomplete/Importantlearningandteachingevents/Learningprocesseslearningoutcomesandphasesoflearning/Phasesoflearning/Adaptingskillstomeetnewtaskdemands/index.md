Sometimes it is important that a particular skill be performed in much
the same way every time that it is used. This is the case in learning to
use a concept name correctly, for example. There is only one correct
name and only one way to pronounce it. The same is true of many more
complex skills. "Behavioral variation in landing an airplane or
performing brain surgery could lead to disaster" (Sulzer-Azaroff &
Mayer, 1991, p. 502).

In other cases, however, the learning outcome which is desired is a
highly transferable set of performances -- a set of performances which
can be adapted to new task demands without the necessity for further
training. This is inevitably the case where the learner must adapt
existing skills to a new setting (e.g. adapt cooking skills to a new
kitchen) and is often the case where a response which has been learned
on one kind of equipment must be adapted in order to operate a different
make of that equipment. When the learner has to make slight adaptations
to previously learned responses or procedures in order to continue
responding correctly to new variations of particular tasks, this is
called *adaptation*. Adaptation is required whenever the learner must
learn to give a *class of responses* to the members of a class of
stimuli.
