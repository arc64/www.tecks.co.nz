In modern research into learning and motivation, consequences are
classified according to their effects. A particular response may work in
the sense that it produces the consequence which we intended it to
produce. We look in the fridge and find the drink which we were seeking.
Or a particular behaviour may fail to work in the sense that it produces
consequences other than the consequence which we intended it to produce.
We look in the fridge and fail to find the drink which we were seeking.
The same is true of practice responses. These too have consequences for
the learner. The learner may be able to see that their response is
correct because it makes sense, or because it matches some model, or
because a teacher or peer acknowledges the answer as correct, and so on.

Different kinds of consequences have different kinds of effects on
practice responses. When consequences are grouped according to their
effect, three general classes of consequences are distinguished. These
three classes are:

-   consequences which make the preceding response *more likely* in the
    future,
-   consequences which make the preceding response *less likely* in the
    future and
-   consequences which have *no effect* on the response which produces
    them.

Consequences which *increase* the likelihood that the learner will
respond in the same way again in the future are referred to as
*reinforcing consequences*. Consequences which *reduce* the likelihood
that the learner will use the preceding response again in the future are
referred to as *aversive consequences*. Consequences which have no
effect on our behaviour are referred to as *neutral consequences*.

Reinforcing consequences are also referred to as "reinforcing stimuli"
or "reinforcing events" or "positive reinforcers" or as "reinforcers".
These terms are synonymous. Reinforcing consequences are sometimes
mistakenly referred to as rewards. This mistake should be avoided. A
reward is something which you hope the recipient will like. A
reinforcing consequence is an event which has a particular kind of
effect on the particular behaviour which produces it (making it more
likely that the learner will respond again in that particular way next
time the situation arises). Aversive consequences are often referred to
as "punishing consequences" or "punishing stimuli" or as "punishers".
These terms, too, are synonymous.

Although they are often overlooked, consequences are just as important
as presentations and prompts. This is because the question of whether or
not a certain response or way of behaving will be learned and used again
in the future depends upon the consequences produced by that response in
the past. This is a very strong research finding which has been
demonstrated hundreds of times.
