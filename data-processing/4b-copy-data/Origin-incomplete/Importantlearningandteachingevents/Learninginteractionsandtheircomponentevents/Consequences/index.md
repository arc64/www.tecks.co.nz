In three-term learning interactions, practice responses have
consequences. During instruction, improvements and non-improvements in
performance typically have different consequences. For example, the
teacher may respond to improvements with praise but react to responses
which show no improvement by asking the learner to "try again".
Likewise, correct responses and incorrect responses tend to have
different consequences. For example, the teacher may mark correct
answers as correct and respond to incorrect answers by showing the
learner how to obtain the correct answer.

Consequences may be classified in many different ways. They may be
classified according to their effects. They may be classified according
to whether these effects are biological or acquired. They may be
classified according to whether they follow correct or incorrect
responses. And they may be classified according to whether they take the
form of feedback, the reactions of others, access to preferred
activities, and so on.

More research has been undertaken into the effects of consequences on
learning than into the effects of any other type of event. This research
indicates very clearly that a number of distinctions between different
kinds of consequences (and response-consequence relationships) are
critical to both the design of effective teaching sequences and the
design of interpretable learning and teaching experiments.
