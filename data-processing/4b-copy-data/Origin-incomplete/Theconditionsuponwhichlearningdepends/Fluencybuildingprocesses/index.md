A learner may acquire the ability to respond correctly without prompting
yet still be unable to respond quickly enough for the new skill to be of
much use. For example, a child may be able to respond correctly to all
single digit addition questions, perhaps by counting up to find the
total but, because the child has to count to find the answer, each
response takes a long time to produce (maybe 6 to 8 seconds).
Responding, although correct, is slow because the child has to work out
the answer to each question and this takes time. With practice, correct
responding becomes faster and more automatic. Eventually the learner
reaches the stage where they can respond sufficiently fluently
(speedily) and effortlessly for the skill to be functional in everyday
life.

Much learning, then, involves not only learning how to perform a
particular skill but how to perform the skill with a functional level of
fluency. Children who have mastered the single digit addition facts are
able to give the answer to an addition fact very quickly. The child who
has mastered the addition facts is able to respond much more quickly
because the answers have been memorised and can be provided
"automatically", that is, without having to spend time consciously
working out each answer. An answer which has been memorised can usually
be recalled in less than a second (Logan & Klapp, 1991).

Not all of the skills and understandings specified in the curriculum
need to be practised to mastery and there has been little research to
identify which skills should be so practised. It seem logical to assume
that all skills which will be needed again at subsequent steps of the
school curriculum should be built to high levels of fluency when first
taught. This review will refer to these skills as *basic skills*. The
most obvious basic skills are those involved in fluent talking, reading,
handwriting, keyboarding, spelling, compositional writing, mathematical
computation, and recognising examples of critically important concepts.

The importance of the fluency building phase of teaching is not always
recognised by teachers. As a consequence, not all students achieve
mastery of (fluency in) the basic skills upon which later learning will
depend.

Research suggests that fluency building is of vital importance for three
separate reasons.

*Fluency is needed for reinforcement and maintenance*. Most skills do
not begin to generate reinforcement for the user until they can be
performed with a certain degree of fluency. An instrumentalist will get
no reinforcement from playing in a band until he or she can play both
accurately and quickly enough to keep up with the other players. Skills
which can be performed quickly and accurately tend to generate more
reinforcement than skills which can only be performed slowly and
hesitantly. A child who can only read at the rate of 50 words a minute
will get much less reinforcement from reading than the child who can
read at 250 words a minute.

Where the aim of teaching is to develop in the learner a skill or skills
which the learner will continue to use, then it is essential that the
target skills be practised until they can be performed fluently enough
to generate reinforcement. If, by the end of instruction, a skill is not
fluent enough to generate its own reinforcement, then that skill is
unlikely to be used when instruction ends. "A child who is able to solve
basic addition facts at a rate of one per minute with perfect accuracy
might know *how* to add, but it is unlikely that he will have *time* to
add in most situations. In order to make a skill truly useful for a
child, we must bring the child's performance up to some level of
*fluency*. He must be able to perform the skill quickly and easily, or
he will probably never use it at all" (White & Haring, 1980, p. 233).

*Fluency is needed for retention.* Skills and understandings which are
practised only to independence are often forgotten. Skills and
understandings which are practised to mastery, on the other hand, tend
to be remembered and to remain functional for a very long time (Bullara,
Kimball & Cooper, 1993; Ivarie, 1986; Olander, Collins, McArthur, Watts
& McDade, 1986; Shirley & Pennypacker, 1994; Singer-Dudeck & Greer,
2005; Sterling, Goetz & Sterling, 1984). Research into remembering is
now quite advanced. The best predictor of remembering, at the conclusion
of instruction and practice, is level of fluency, that is the speed with
which responses can be recalled.

A child who has achieved a high level of fluency in basic multiplication
facts will probably remember these multiplication facts for the rest of
his or her life. The reason for this is that responses cannot be
performed quickly until they have been "memorised" and, once something
has been memorised to the point where it can be immediately recalled, it
tends to be remembered for long periods of time. Where the aim of
teaching is to develop in the learner a set of correct responses, or a
set of knowledge responses which must be remembered because they will be
needed again at some later time, then it is essential that these
responses be practised until they can be instantly recalled.

*Fluency needed for subsequent learning.* Not only does level of fluency
predict long term retention it also predicts rate of improvement with
respect to more advanced skills. One of the first demonstrations of the
importance of bringing basic skills to adequate levels of fluency was
provided by Haughton (1972) who studied the effects of a variety of
remedial teaching strategies which could be used with students who were
having difficulty with maths. He found that bringing the students to
fluency on basic skills (e.g. basic addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division and fraction operations) had a far greater
effect in accelerating future learning than any other kind of remedial
work. Since Haughton's initial demonstration there have been a number of
further experimental demonstrations of the rule that, when tool skills
lower in the curriculum hierarchy are practised to high levels of
fluency, skills which build upon these earlier skills are acquired much
more quickly (Clark, 2001; Evans & Evans, 1985; Evans, Mercer & Evans,
1983; Johnson & Layng, 1992; McDowell & Keenan, 2002; Van Houten &
Sharma (nd) cited in Van Houten, 1980). "Our charts show us again and
again that the higher the prerequisite skill rates, the faster a complex
skill will be learned" (Johnson & Layng, 1992, p. 1480).

It is thought that new skills are acquired more quickly when the
component skills are fluent for two main reasons. First, the student who
has practised component skills to a high level of fluency is able to
concentrate more completely on learning the new task or procedure.
Secondly, the student who has practised component skills to a high level
of fluency is able to work more quickly and to complete more practice
examples involving the more advanced skill in the time available.
Students who have achieved high levels of fluency in tool skills at the
time when they are first taught also seem to find school work less
effortful and more enjoyable and tend to require less external
reinforcement in order to maintain adequate levels of motivation. Such
students are often referred to as students who are "intrinsically
motivated".

In fact, several studies have shown that fluency in the basic skills is
strongly correlated with both current levels of achievement and future
growth. In other words, a student\'s level of fluency in basic skills
can be used to predict future achievement levels. "The number of words
read aloud correctly and incorrectly from a basal text reliably and
validly discriminates growth in reading proficiency throughout the
elementary school years" (Deno, 1985, p. 224).
