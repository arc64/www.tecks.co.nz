Causal explanations tend to be the most useful kinds of explanations
because they enable prediction and, hence, can be used as a guide to
action. In the social sciences, causal explanations are often referred
to as functional explanations and the search for causes is often
referred to as the search for functional relationships. "The goal of
experimentation is to learn enough about the effects of the independent
variable on the dependent variable to be able to show that the dependent
variable depends on or is a function of the independent variable and
nothing else. When this goal has been fully accomplished, it is called a
*functional relation*" (Johnston & Pennypacker, 1993, p. 238).
