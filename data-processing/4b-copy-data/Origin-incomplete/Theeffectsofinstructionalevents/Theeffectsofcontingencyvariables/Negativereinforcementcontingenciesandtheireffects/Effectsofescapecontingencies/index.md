The effects of escape contingencies in educational settings appears to
have been little studied. This is probably because such studies would
involve the application of an aversive stimulus which would continue in
effect until the child engaged in the desired escape response. It is
probable that many of the off-task behaviours and disruptive behaviours
in which children engage in the classroom are escape responses which
have the effect of terminating contact with aversive classroom tasks (at
least briefly) and a number of functional analyses of children's
tantrums have shown this to be the case both in children with persistent
behaviour problems (Heckaman, Conroy, Fox & Chait, 2000) and in children
without behaviour problems (e.g. Lee Wilder, Chen, Atwell, Pritchard &
Weinstein, 2006).
