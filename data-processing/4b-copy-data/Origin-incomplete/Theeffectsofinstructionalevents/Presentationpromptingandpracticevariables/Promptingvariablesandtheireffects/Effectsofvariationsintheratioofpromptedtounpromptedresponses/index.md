There have been few experimental studies of the effects of prompting
just some, rather than all unknown responses during the initial
acquisition phase. Presumably this is because it is fairly self-evident
that correct responses can only be acquired if the child is assisted to
make a correct response in the first instance. This was confirmed by
Noell, Gresham and Gansle (2002) in an experiment involving 7 year olds
who were learning new addition and subtraction operations. Continuous
delivery of instructional prompts was the most effective treatment for
all participants.
