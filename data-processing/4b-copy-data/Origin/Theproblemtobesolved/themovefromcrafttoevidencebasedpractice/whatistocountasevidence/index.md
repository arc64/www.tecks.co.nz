Suggestions that teaching practice might be based on research evidence
do not always deal with the question "what kinds of research evidence?"
This is an important question because educational researchers employ a
variety of different kinds of research procedures and different research
procedures generate different kinds of knowledge.

Secondly educational researchers work at different levels of specificity
and hence their research results vary widely with respect to their level
of applicability in practical settings such as classrooms.

Thirdly, educational researchers vary with respect to the degree of
quality control which they attempt to achieve over the subject matter of
their investigations and this in turn results in variations in the
believability of their findings.

Fourthly, the effects of some teaching procedures on some learning
outcomes have been studied much more frequently than others and this
results in research-derived knowledge with widely differing levels of
research support.

These difference are compounded when educational researchers attempt to
review the research literature, especially when they try to look across
investigations which have used different types of research method, and
this results in review-based conclusions which vary widely with respect
to their validity and believability.
