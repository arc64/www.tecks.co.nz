For most of the 20th century, the primary datum of educational and
psychological research has been the average of the scores of samples of
subjects on some kind of test, rating scale or self-report instrument.
Where experiments have been undertaken, these have most commonly
involved the exposure of two or more groups of subjects to different
treatments, calculation of the mean outcome score for each group, and
the use of these mean scores as the measure of treatment effects.

The results of studies using this research methodology first began to
appear in educational research publications in the early 1900s. The
first educational experiment involving a control group appears to have
been a study published by Edward Thorndike in 1901 (Woodworth &
Thorndike, 1901). The statistical rules which are commonly used to
interpret differences between the mean scores of groups of subjects were
developed during the first quarter of the 20th century.

Galton was the first to make extensive use of the normal curve to study
psychological problems. . . . In 1896, Pearson, who worked under Galton,
published the formula for the product-moment correlation coefficient. In
the first decade of the 1900s, the essentials of the correlational
method, including the theory of regression, were developed, especially
by \[the\] British statisticians, Pearson and Yule. . . . Researchers
were also aware of the statistical significance of differences. In 1908,
under the name of Student, Gossett showed how to measure the standard
error of the mean and the principle of the t-test was formulated. . . .
In 1916, McCall, a student of Thorndike . . . recommended the setting up
of random experimental and control groups. . . . The contribution of Sir
Ronald Fisher was critical. With the publication of his *Statistical
Methods for Research Workers* in 1925, small-sample inferential
statistics became known, but were not immediately utilised. . . . In
1935, Fisher published his famous *The Design of Experiments,*
originally conceived for agriculture, and not widely applied in
education research before the late 1940s (de Landsheere, 1997, p. 11).

Because means (and correlations) became the primary data in educational
and psychological research with very little debate, there has been
little discussion of what this particular approach to educational
research should be called. It has been variously referred to as
mainstream educational research (e.g., Borg & Gall, 1989), the
scientific approach (e.g., Kerlinger, 1964, Walker & Evers, 1997), the
empirical-analytic approach (Popkewitz, 1984), the normative approach
(Cohen & Manion, 1994), quantitative research (Martella, Nelson &
Marchand-Martella, 1999), positivistic research (by interpretivist
researchers), between subjects research (Reber, 1995), between-groups
research (Church, 1996), and social science research (Krathwohl, 1993).
In this book, we will use the term *social science research* to refer to
the family of research procedures which involve the selection of one or
more samples of subjects, the application of one or more measures to
these subjects, and the attempt to draw conclusions either from
correlations between the several measures or from differences between
the mean scores of subgroups of subjects.

By the 1950s, the collection of sets of scores and the interpretation of
these using correlational or inferential statistics had become the most
commonly used method for studying learning and teaching, and it
continues to be the most commonly used method to this day. In 1995, some
60% of the studies of human learning and teaching published in
educational psychology journals involved the application of some kind of
social science research procedure (Church, 1998). The social science
methodology and its assumptions are deeply entrenched in the belief
systems of educational researchers, their publication practices, and the
training programmes which they provide for novice researchers.

**Definition.** Social science research is research which aims primarily
to collect data on the performance or characteristics of groups or
samples of people. Social science research is often undertaken to test a
theory about the relationships between two or more aspects of human
ability, cognitive functioning, or teaching method, and it attempts to
accomplish this by applying one or more tests or self-report measures to
samples of subjects and by aggregating the obtained scores to produce an
average score for each of the groups of interest. The data which is
collected is almost always interpreted with the aid of descriptive,
correlational, or inferential statistics. The social science research
which is most directly relevant to the study of learning and teaching is
an area of research which has come to be known as cognitive science.
