The teacher or teacher educator who examines a sample of behaviour
analysis reports will find that most of these are reports of
within-subject experiments, that the data have been presented separately
for each learner (rather than being aggregated), that the data have been
presented graphically (rather than statistically), and that some attempt
has been made to determine whether or not the experimental effect is
reproducible either across participants or else across occasions.
Examination of the thousands of experiments undertaken to date further
reveals that most of the relationships which are being studied have been
the subject of repeated experimental analysis under a variety of
conditions and that replication is the norm rather than the exception.
As a consequence, the experimental analyses of the behaviour analyst
work in the sense that they regularly generate believable data and they
frequently generate reproducible results. These experiments are also
generating results which can be generalised to individual learners. This
makes these results much more useful to the practising teacher than the
results of between-groups experiments which cannot be generalised to
individual learners.
