Ethnographic research is almost always descriptive. Ethnographers rarely
undertake comparative evaluations or experiments. In fact, ethnographers
go to some pains *not* to manipulate the setting in which they are
working. "Investigators take care to avoid purposive manipulation of
variables in the study" (LeCompte & Preissle, 1993, p. 3). Because
researchers who engage in ethnographic and other kinds of qualitative
research do not conduct experiments, they have no way of finding out
whether an apparent relationship (e.g. between a particular kind of
classroom experience and a particular kind of attitude on the part of
the students) is a functional relationship or whether it just appeared
that way to the researcher. Because qualitative research is purely
descriptive, its only use is in developing answers to descriptive
questions of the form "What is going on here?" While a qualitative study
may point to possible relationships -- relationships which might be
studied by behaviour analysts or cognitive scientists, this all that
they can accomplish.
