In order to acquire a new concept or generalisation, the learner must
have the opportunity to work with a range of examples of the concept.
Research suggests that, in order to acquire an accurate understanding of
the concept, these positive examples must illustrate the full range of
the generalisation which is to be acquired. In a series of experiments
undertaken by Carnine and his colleagues, students who were presented
with a full range of positive examples of how to convert fractions into
decimals performed higher on a generalisation test (82% correct) than
students who were presented with only a restricted range of examples
(40% correct) (Becker & Carnine, 1980).
