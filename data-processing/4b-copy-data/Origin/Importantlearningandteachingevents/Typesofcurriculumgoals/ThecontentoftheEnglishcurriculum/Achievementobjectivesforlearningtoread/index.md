The achievement objectives for the teaching of reading during the first
six years of schooling are stated in the English section of the New
Zealand curriculum in the following form.

**Level 1**

*Students will:*

-   Acquire and begin to use sources of information, processes, and
    strategies to identify, form, and express ideas.

indicators:

-   selects and reads texts for enjoyment and personal fulfilment;
-   has an awareness of the connections between oral, written, and
    visual language;
-   uses sources of information (meaning, structure, visual and
    grapho-phonic information) and prior knowledge to make sense of a
    range of texts;
-   associates sounds with letter clusters as well as with individual
    letters;
-   uses processing and some comprehension strategies with some
    confidence;
-   is developing the ability to think critically about texts;
-   begins to monitor, self-evaluate, and describe progress.
-   Recognise and identify ideas within and across texts.

indicators:

-   understands that personal experience can influence the meaning
    gained from texts;
-   makes meaning of texts by identifying ideas in some texts.
-   Recognise and begin to understand how language features are used for
    effect within and across texts.

indicators:

-   begins to recognise that oral, written, and visual language features
    can be used for effect;
-   recognises a large bank of high-frequency and some topic-specific
    words;
-   shows some knowledge of the text conventions, such as capital
    letters, full stops, and word order; volume and clarity; and simple
    symbols.

**Level 2**

*Students will:*

-   Select and use sources of information, processes, and strategies
    with some confidence to identify, form, and express ideas.

indicators:

-   selects and reads texts for enjoyment and personal fulfilment;
-   recognises connections between oral, written, and visual language
-   selects and uses sources of information (meaning, structure, visual
    and grapho-phonic information) and prior knowledge with growing
    confidence to make sense of increasingly varied and complex texts;
-   uses an increasing knowledge of letter clusters, affixes, roots, and
    compound words to confirm predictions;
-   selects and uses processing strategies and an increasing range of
    comprehension strategies with some understanding and confidence;
-   thinks critically about texts with some confidence;
-   monitors, self-evaluates, and describes progress with some
    confidence.
-   Show some understanding of ideas within, across, and beyond texts.

indicators:

-   uses their personal experience and world and literacy knowledge to
    make meaning from texts;
-   makes meaning of increasingly complex texts by identifying main
    ideas;
-   makes and supports inferences from texts with some independence.
-   Show some understanding of how language features are used for effect
    within and across texts.

indicators:

-   recognises that oral, written, and visual language features can be
    used for effect;
-   uses a large and increasing bank of high-frequency, topic-specific,
    and personal content words to make meaning;
-   shows an increasing knowledge of the conventions of text;
-   recognises that authors have different voices and styles.

**Level 3**

*Students will:*

-   Integrate sources of information, processes, and strategies with
    developing confidence to identify, form, and express ideas.

indicators:

-   selects and reads texts for enjoyment and personal fulfilment;
-   recognises and understands the connections between oral, written,
    and visual language;
-   integrates sources of information and prior knowledge with
    developing confidence to make sense of increasingly varied and
    complex texts;
-   selects and uses a range of processing and comprehension strategies
    with growing understanding and confidence;
-   thinks critically about texts with developing confidence;
-   monitors, self-evaluates, and describes progress with growing
    confidence.
-   Show a developing understanding of ideas within, across, and beyond
    texts.

indicators:

-   uses their personal experience and world and literacy knowledge
    confidently to make meaning from texts;
-   makes meaning of increasingly complex texts by identifying main and
    subsidiary ideas in them;
-   starts to make connections by thinking about underlying ideas in and
    between texts;
-   recognises that there may be more than one reading available within
    a text;
-   makes and supports inferences from texts with increasing
    independence.
-   Show a developing understanding of how language features are used
    for effect within and across texts.

indicators:

-   identifies oral, written, and visual language features used in texts
    and recognises their effects;
-   uses an increasing vocabulary to make meaning;
-   shows an increasing knowledge of how a range of text conventions can
    be used appropriately;
-   knows that authors have different voices and styles and can identify
    some of these differences.

Teachers also have access to two supplementary publications (Ministry of
Education, 1996, 2003). The first of these, *The learner as a reader*
(Ministry of Education 1996), contains a simple account of how children
learn to read, description of a procedure for decoding unknown words
(prompt a guess -- prompt re-reading -- prompt decoding), guidance on
how to administer and interpret untimed running records of reading,
descriptions of the main types of classroom reading activities (shared
reading, shared writing, guided reading, personal reading), descriptions
of types of texts (genres), and classroom activities appropriate to
different types of texts. The focus is on classroom reading activities
and there are few references to achievement objectives or to expected
rates of improvement from one year to the next.

The second, *Effective literacy practice* (Ministry of Education, 2003)
is a handbook for teachers on how to teach reading and writing to
children in years 1 to 4. It reproduces many of the reading activities
described in *The learner as a reader.* It also includes several new,
research-based teaching activities (activities such as using rhymes and
word games to teach phonemic awareness, activities to teach letter-sound
relationships, activities such as reciprocal reading to teach
comprehension monitoring, and so on). *Effective literacy practice*
represents a step forward in that it includes, for the first time, a
list of "developmental indicators" for reading during the first four
years of schooling. Some of these "developmental indicators" are listed
in the following table.

*Table 2221 "Developmental indicators" for reading listed in "Effective
Literacy Practice" (Ministry of Education, 2003)*

*Year 1*

-   One-to-one matching, directionality and return sweep well
    established
-   Letter-sound relationships secure for all single letters and for
    some consonant digraphs and consonant blends
-   Can sound out simple, decodable words in text
-   Has a large and increasing bank of automatically recognised
    high-frequency words
-   Uses meaning, structure, visual and grapho-phonic information and
    prior knowledge to make sense of what is read
-   Self monitors and uses prediction and self-correction with
    increasing confidence
-   Understands the purposes of some punctuations marks
-   Can use phrasing, intonation and emphasis to read expressively
-   Reads at or beyond the Blue to Green levels on the Ready to Read
    series

*Year 4*

-   Integrates, meaning, structure, grapho-phonic information and prior
    knowledge when reading
-   Self-monitors and uses processing strategies effectively
-   Uses word-identification strategies appropriately and automatically
    when encountering unknown words
-   Can use a range of comprehension strategies: can analyse and
    interpret what the author is saying, make inferences and justify
    them, and make connections
-   Can gather, process, and evaluate information
-   Usually reads silently
-   Can read aloud with expression and fluency
-   Has a strong sense of what they like to read and can locate such
