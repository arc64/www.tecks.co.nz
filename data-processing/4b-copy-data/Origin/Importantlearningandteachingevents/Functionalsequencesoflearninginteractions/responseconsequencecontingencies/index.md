From the very first occasions on which they are attempted, most
behaviours have consequences. The kinds of consequences which can result
from a particular response, behaviour or action have been described in
earlier sections. They include reinforcing consequences (reinforcers)
and aversive consequences (punishers), biologically determined and
learned reinforcers and punishers, consequences which are natural
outcomes of our behaviour, consequences which take the form of
opportunities to engage in other behaviours, consequences which consist
of reactions from other people, and consequences in the form of feedback
regarding the success or otherwise of our behaviour.

In addition, most behaviours (e.g. reading) are engaged in over and over
again. When we begin to track repeated use of the same response over
time we discover that different kinds of relationships can exist between
a particular behaviour and its consequences. In this section we describe
some of the different arrangements which can exist between an action
which is being engaged in repeatedly and the consequences which are
resulting from that action. The relationship between a behaviour which
is being used repeatedly and its consequences or outcomes is referred to
as a *contingency*. *The term contingency refers to a relationship
between a particular behaviour and its consequences.*

While many kinds of contingencies are possible, most are combinations of
the following six basic types of contingencies: positive and negative
reinforcement, positive and negative punishment, recovery and
extinction.

These six contingencies are distinguished because they have differing
effects on learning, on our motivation to engage in particular
behaviours, and on our liking for particular courses of action. The
importance of being able to recognise these six contingencies cannot be
overemphasised. It is essential that all teachers be able to distinguish
between these six contingencies because a failure to recognise the
contingencies which are operating in a particular setting will leave the
teacher unable to identify the causes of many of the behaviour changes,
motivational changes and attitudinal changes which are occurring (or
failing to occur) in the classroom, the playground, and so on.
