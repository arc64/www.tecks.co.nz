During explanations and other types of presentation sequences, the
concept or principle under examination will usually be illustrated or
given meaning by the use of selected examples. The number of examples
may vary from a single example to a set of examples. A set of examples
may be "typical" examples or they may be more varied. Some textbooks
argue that concept examples should be selected to illustrate the outer
boundaries of the stimulus class, that is, the set of examples should
consist of a set of examples which are as varied as possible.

The range of examples contained in a sequence of presentations is an
important variable because it is this variable which operates to
determine, in part, the degree of generalised understanding which the
learner will develop. This variable also plays a role in preventing the
development of misconceptions about new concepts. If only a limited set
of examples of a new concept are used the learner may develop an
undergeneralised understanding of the concept.
