When the learner is having difficulty in responding, the teacher may
provide several opportunities for the student to make the one response.
In the following case, the student\'s first response was incorrect, so
the teacher pointed to a particular part of the written problem and
repeated the question in a second attempt to get the student to respond
correctly. In this kind of interaction, the initial question or response
opportunity is referred to as the *primary* *question* and subsequent
attempts to elicit the same response are referred to as *secondary
questions*.

secondary question*

In this example there is only one learning interaction (although there
are two responses) because both responses are attempts to answer the
same question.

The distinction between antecedents and consequences is an important one
because the two types of stimulus events have very different kinds of
effects on learning. Antecedent events provide practice opportunities
and this is an important function because, without practice responses
there would be no learning. But it is the consequences of practice
responses which operate to determine whether or not a particular
practice response will be remembered and used again in the future.
