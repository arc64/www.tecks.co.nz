Assuming that the teacher has selected a developmentally appropriate
teaching aim, that is one which the child can achieve given suitable
assistance, research suggests that the number of practice opportunities
experienced by the child with respect to each of the to-be-learned
responses will be a major determinant of whether or not these responses
will be acquired (learned) and remembered. The term *practice
opportunity* refers to each occasion where the child gets to practice
(either with or without assistance) one of the responses, skills or
understandings contained in their current teaching aim. Most teachers
know, at least intuitively, that remembering depends upon practice which
is why they include some kind of practice or \"consolidation\" activity
within most units of work. Of course acquisition and remembering are two
different processes and the research into practice suggests that whether
or not acquisition itself will occur is also closely dependent upon the
number of learning opportunities experienced by the child.

The relationship between opportunity to learn and learning has been
demonstrated for achievement in general (e.g., Thurlow, Ysseldyke,
Graden & Algozzine, 1984), vocabulary development (e.g., Elley, 1989;
Hart & Risley, 1995; McKeown, Beck, Omanson, & Pople, 1985), reading
readiness on entry to school (Bus, van Izjendoorn & Pellegrini, 1995),
growth in reading and reading comprehension (e.g., Allen, Cipielewski &
Stanovich, 1992; Anderson, Wilson & Fielding, 1988; Gettinger, 1991;
Martin, 1991), spelling (e.g., Delquadri, Greenwood, Stretton & Hall,
1983; Greenwood, Delquadri & Hall, 1984; McLaughlin, Reiter, Mabee, &
Byram, 1991), maths (e.g., Albers & Greer, 1991), and general subject
matter areas such science, social studies, and health (e.g., Gardner,
Heward & Grossi, 1994; Nuthall & Alton-Lee, 1993; Sterling, Barbetta,
Heward & Heron, 1997).

The relationship between number of response opportunities and rate of
acquisition was first demonstrated in experimental studies of what
happens when the teacher increases the number of response opportunities
experienced by each child using such procedures as self-practice,
response cards, and choral responding.

**Self-directed practice**

The self-directed practice procedure which has been most extensively
analysed is "cover-copy-compare" This is a generic procedure for
practising equivalence relations and other forms of correct responding.
Typically it involves examining the stimulus (e.g., a new spelling word)
covering it, attempting to write it, and self-checking this response by
comparing it against the original (uncovered) stimulus. If the response
is incorrect, the student repeats the cover-copy-compare process and, if
the response is correct, the student moves to the next item to be
practised.

The research on cover-copy-compare has been reviewed by Skinner,
McLaughlin & Logan (1997) who summarised the results of 17 separate
experiments. Skinner et al. (1997, p. 304) concluded that
cover-copy-compare was "an effective, efficient procedure for improving
students' academic performance across a variety of curricula objectives
and skills domains." Controlled studies of cover-copy-compare and its
effects included demonstrations of accelerated rates of acquisition in
spelling (McLaughlin et al., 1991; Murphy, Hern, Williams & McLaughlin,
1990; Pratt-Struthers, Bartalamay, Williams & McLaughlin, 1989;
Schemerhorn & McLaughlin, 1997), sight words (Conley, Derby,
Roberts-Gwinn, Weber & McLaughlin, 2004), maths facts (Skinner, Ford &
Yunker, 1991; Skinner, Shapiro, Turco, Cole & Brown, 1992; Skinner,
Beatty, Turco & Rasafage, 1989; Stading, Williams & McLaughlin, 1996),
and geography facts (Skinner, Belfiore & Pierce, 1992).

Introduction of cover-copy-compare in the learning of new spelling words
typically results in a 2-fold increase in rate of acquisition in both
normally developing children and in children with learning disabilities
(Church, 1990). The procedure has also been shown to produce accelerated
fluency development (Skinner, Bamburg, Smith & Powell, 1993).

**Response card procedures**

A number of studies have attempted to measure what happens when the
classroom teacher requires every child in the classroom to respond to
every classroom question -- usually by writing down the answer to each
question. In some studies, the students are required to hold up their
response cards for the teacher to see. The response card research has
been reviewed by Randolph (2007) who reviewed 18 experiments. The
effects of the response card treatment have been measured using 9 year
olds engaged in maths lessons (Christie & Schuster, 2003) and health
science lessons (Sterling, Barbetta, Heward & Heron, 1997), with 10 year
old students engaged in science lessons (Church, 1976; Gardner, Heward &
Grossi, 1994), with 12 year olds in writing lessons (Davis & O'Neil,
2004), with 14-year old students engaged in earth science lessons
(Cavanaugh, Heward & Donelson, 1996), and with university students
(Miller & Malott, 1997). In every single experiment the results have
been the same. When students are required to produce a written answer to
every teacher question their scores on next day quizzes and weekly tests
increase dramatically. Several of these experiments have also documented
a collateral increase in on task behaviour during the course of the
experimental lessons (e.g. Christie & Schuster 2003). The behaviour and
attention of children with behaviour problems also improves markedly
(Randolph, 2007).

**Unison responding**

One of the features of the small group teaching procedure used in Direct
Instruction classrooms is rapid-paced unison responding to teacher
questions. The unison responding requires every child to respond to
every teacher question. The introduction of Direct Instruction
procedures into the classroom invariably results in accelerated student
progress (Adams & Engelmann, 1996). While this accelerated progress
cannot be directly attributed to the greatly increased number of
response opportunities experienced by all children, the Direct
Instruction evaluations in conjunction with the research already
reviewed in this section suggests that the greatly increased number of
response opportunities which occur in Direct Instruction classrooms
almost certainly plays a role in the accelerated progress produced by
the teaching procedure employed by Direct Instruction teachers.
