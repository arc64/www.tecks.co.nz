Practice responses may be timed or untimed. During the initial
acquisition phase, teachers tend to be more concerned with improvements
in the learner's ability to respond correctly and untimed practice is
usually appropriate. Later, however, we often require students to
develop a certain level of mastery, that is, to learn to respond both
correctly and with a functional level of speed. In order to develop
speed, practice activities need to be timed so that both the teacher and
the student can determine whether or not increases in speed are being
achieved. It can be seen therefore that timed and untimed practice serve
quite different functions and must therefore be clearly distinguished
both during instructional planning and during the design of learning and
teaching experiments.
