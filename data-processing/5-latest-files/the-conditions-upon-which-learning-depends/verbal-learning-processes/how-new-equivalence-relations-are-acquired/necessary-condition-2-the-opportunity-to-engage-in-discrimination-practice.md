The great majority of the equivalence relations taught in schools come
in sets: for example the 52 letters, the 43 English phonemes, the 300
words which occur most frequently in written English, the 100 single
digit multiplication facts, and so on.

In order to master a set of equivalence relations the learner must first
learn to distinguish between each of the stimulus items in the set (e.g.
the 26 letters) and, when this has been accomplished to learn the
correct response to each of these stimulus items (e.g. to say the letter
name, or the most common letter sound).

Because equivalence relations come in sets, they are most commonly
taught and practised in subsets of the entire set. This is appropriate
because it is only by practising equivalence relations in sets that the
learner comes gradually to discriminate between each of the stimulus
items (e.g. letters) in the set. Practising in sets is especially
important where the stimulus items are similar in appearance. A learner
who recognises (and responds correctly to) the printed word through on
its own, will not necessarily be able to distinguish between (and
correctly read) the words through, though, trough, tough, and thought.
In order to acquire the ability to respond correctly to *each* of these
words, instruction must include opportunities to practise responding to
these words when they are grouped together as well as when they are
presented separately. Only if the learner has the opportunity to
practise discriminating between similar looking items, will he or she
learn to discriminate between these items and to respond correctly to
each.

The unanswered question is the question of how large these practice sets
should be. Should the sets be small or large? Does the set size which is
most appropriate vary with the age of the learner? Should the set size
increase as the learner moves from the initial learning phase through to
the fluency building phase? Research into the optimum size of practice
sets suggests that these sets must be larger than the number of
responses which the learner can hold in short term memory but small
enough to allow several attempts at each item during a single practice
session (e.g., Ferkis, Belfiore & Skinner, 1997; Gleason, Carnine &
Vala, 1991; Johnson, Gersten & Carnine, 1987). Johnson et al. (1987)
found that 14- to 16-year old students who studied the meanings of
vocabulary words in sets of 10 learned the new meanings more quickly
than students who studied the words in sets of 25. Once the learner
reaches the fluency building stage however, the set size needs to be
greatly increased. At the point of this transition the set size is
normally increased to at least 80 stimulus items so that the child can
practice, using 1 minute sprints, towards the goal of 60 to 70 correct
responses per minute (Keel, Slatton & Blackhurst, 2001).
