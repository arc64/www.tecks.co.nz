If the correct response to a new stimulus is to be learned and
remembered, correct practice responses must be differentially
reinforced, that is, correct responses must be followed by consequences
which unambiguously signal that the correct response has been made and
incorrect responses must be identified as errors (Johnson, Schuster &
Bell, 1996). The rate of learning of new equivalence relations is
largely dependent upon the number of practice opportunities provided for
each response and the extent to which correct responses are
differentially reinforced (Barbetta, Heward & Bradley, 1993; McNeish,
Heron & Okyere, 1992; Morton, Heward & Alber, 1998).

The differential reinforcement of correct responses may be accomplished
in a variety of ways. It may be accomplished by telling the learner
whether their responses are correct or incorrect, by the immediate
marking of written practice responses, by providing flash cards with the
answers on the back, by putting learners into pairs where one student
can practise while the other checks each answer as correct or incorrect,
or by providing a table of equivalences which the learner can use to
check the correctness of their own practice responses (e.g., McNeish et
al., 1992). Self-correction immediately following each error results in
faster acquisition than delayed self-correction (Morton et al., 1998).
