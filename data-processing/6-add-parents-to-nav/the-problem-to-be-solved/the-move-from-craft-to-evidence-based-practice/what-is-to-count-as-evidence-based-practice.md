Teaching, in its successful forms, is an activity which results in
series of transformations. A particular learner arrives with a
particular set of skills, understandings, interests, and beliefs
acquired as a result of prior learning and is transformed into an
individual with one or more additional skills, understandings, interests
and/or beliefs which they did not have before.

These transformations are most commonly referred to as "learning" and
activities which are specifically designed with the intention of
inducing such transformations are commonly referred to as "teaching".
Some authors refer to teaching as "pedagogy" but, in this site, we will
stick with the plain English term *teaching*.

Evidence-based practice is most commonly defined as teaching which
employs procedures practices and materials which are known, on the basis
of controlled evaluation research, to be effective in bringing about
particular learning outcomes in particular groups of learners (Slavin,
2002).
