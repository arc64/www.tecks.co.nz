The teaching activities which occur in classrooms have changed little
during the past 80 years -- a fact which has been documented many times.
Compare this with the very considerable scientific and technological
advances which have occurred in almost all other professions during the
20th century. Unlike medical practice, where the traditional craft
philosophy of patient care was gradually replaced by the revolutionary
new clinical science during the first half of the 20th century, teaching
practice has remained, to this day, a craft largely untouched by the
scientific research on learning and teaching.

It does not need to be this way. Very considerable advances have been
made in the scientific analysis of both learning and teaching. However,
it is true that the scientific research into learning and teaching is
buried under a mountain of pre-scientific research. This makes the
scientific research difficult to find and difficult to use in the
development of more effective classroom teaching practices and
programmes.

In this book we examine the nature of the problem to be solved, examine
what would count as evidence-based practice, ask whether a move from
craft-based to evidence-based practice is possible at this time, and
identify some of the conditions which will need to be present before a
change from craft-based to evidence-based practice is likely to occur.
