The act of spelling involves reproducing the correct sequence of letters
for a particular word. The stimulus may be either the spoken word (as
when taking notes) or it may be the thought of the word (as when
composing). The response may be oral, written, or typed. Competent
spelling involves the ability to translate phonemes into graphemes with
a high degree of accuracy (Hallahan, Kauffman & Lloyd, 1985).

Written English is partly phonetic and partly morphological (Dixon,
1991; Moats, 1995; Simonsen & Gunter, 2001; Templeton & Morris, 2000).
This is one of the reasons why the English language has some 250
different spellings for its 43 phonemes. Of these, some 170 are
reasonably common (Mann, 2003; Moats, 1995). Knowledge of sound-spelling
relationships is variously referred to as knowledge of the alphabetic
principle, graphophonemic knowledge, knowledge of spelling-sound
relationships, knowledge of sound-syllable correspondences, knowledge of
spelling rules, knowledge of phoneme-grapheme conversion rules, and so
on. The technical term is knowledge of *phoneme-grapheme* equivalence
relations.

In a limited number of cases, the reversibility property will ensure
that once a child has learned a particular grapheme--\>phoneme
equivalence during learning to read (e.g. see the letter t --\>say the
sound \|t\| ) then the child will have learned also the phoneme-grapheme
equivalence (i.e. hear the sound \|t\|--\>write the letter t ) (Sidman,
1994). However, this will only be true for the equivalence relations
which involve one-to-one correspondences and this is a relatively small
proportion of the total in reading and an even smaller proportion of the
total in spelling.

According to Moats (1995), at least 20 English language phonemes have
spellings which are predictable over 90% of the time and a further 10
phonemes have spellings which are predictable over 80% of the time. The
spelling of only eight phonemes is predictable less than 78% per cent of
the time and five of these are vowel sounds. This means that the
spelling of the so called "regular words" which, according to Moats
(1995), comprise some 50% of all words can be derived from a knowledge
of phoneme--\>grapheme equivalences. Because a mastery of regularly
occurring phoneme--\>grapheme equivalence relations allows students to
engage in self-directed learning of regularly spelled words (and many of
the syllables of irregularly spelled words), it can be seen that pursuit
of this learning outcome is essential if a child is to become a
competent writer. Although not systematically taught at the present
time, these equivalence relations could be systematically taught thereby
greatly accelerating the rate at which young children learn to write.
