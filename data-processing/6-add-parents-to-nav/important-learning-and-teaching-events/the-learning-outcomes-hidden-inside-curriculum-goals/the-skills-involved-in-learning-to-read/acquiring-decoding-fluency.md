Once the child has learned the code (or at least the first 80 or so
items of the code) the ability to read these commonly occurring
graphemes needs to be built to a functional level of fluency
(automaticity) so that a correct response occurs almost instantaneously
and without conscious effort. "To be useful, any given individual
letter-sound correspondence or phonic generalisation must not merely be
learned; it must be overlearned such that it is instantly and
effortlessly available to the reader" (Adams, 1990, p. 291).

We will refer to the fast reading of individual graphemes as *decoding
fluency*. Decoding fluency refers to the speed with which the child can
see and correctly say the commonly occurring grapheme--\>phoneme
equivalences of his or her native language. Of course, learning to
instantly recognise the most commonly occurring grapheme--\>phoneme
equivalence relations is not the end of the story. This skill must still
be generalised to include less commonly occurring letter-sound
relationships (e.g. reading the final syllable of plateau as a long
\|o\| sound), to include commonly occurring syllables and morphemes
(e.g. pre- and -less); to encompass context-sensitive regularities (soft
and hard g and c), to include positional regularities (e.g. final versus
initial y), and to include semantic constraints (e.g. their and there)
(Share and Stanovich, 1995).

The level of automaticity which distinguishes good from poor readers
appears to be between 60 and 70 correct responses per minute (Church,
Nixon, Williams & Zintl, 2005). Achievement of this level of decoding
fluency is an important milestone in learning to read because, until
this level of fluency is achieved, the decoding of unknown words is
likely to be too slow for the child to maintain comprehension over
passages containing unknown words and the level of prose reading fluency
is likely to be too slow to be sufficiently interesting to motivate the
large amount of reading practice which is required in order to become a
competent reader.
