Critical to learning to read is the acquisition, in a timely fashion, of
the ability to translate English language graphemes (letters and letter
groups) into phonemes. Being able to translate written graphemes into
spoken phonemes is variously referred to as sounding out, word attack,
phonics, phonological recoding, cipher reading, deciphering, knowledge
of the alphabetic principle, graphophonemic knowledge, knowledge of
spelling-sound relationships, knowledge of letter-sound relationships,
grapheme-phoneme correspondences, grapheme-phoneme conversion rules,
decoding skills, and so on. We will use the term *decoding skills* and
will define decoding skills as the ability, given an English language
grapheme in the context of a word, to say (that is, pronounce) that
grapheme.

Acquisition of grapheme-phoneme equivalence relations involves learning
a set of discriminated oral responses where the stimulus takes the form
of a grapheme (a letter or group of letters) and the response takes the
form of a correctly pronounced sound. In the case of the phoneme \|f\|,
for example, the child needs to learn three common grapheme-phoneme
relations: (a)Â see f -\> say \|f\|, (b) see ph -\> say \|f\| and (c) see
a terminal gh -\> say \|f\| (sometimes). There are 43 possible oral
responses (because there are 43 English language phonemes).

The English language represents its 43 phonemes with some 250 different
spellings. Of these, about 170 are reasonably common (Moats, 1995). Of
these, it has been suggested that 70 to 80 might be specifically taught
during the process of learning to read (Carnine, Silbert & Kameenui,
1990). There is, however, no agreement on which grapheme-phoneme
relations should be specifically taught during the first three years of
reading instruction (Adams, 1990).
