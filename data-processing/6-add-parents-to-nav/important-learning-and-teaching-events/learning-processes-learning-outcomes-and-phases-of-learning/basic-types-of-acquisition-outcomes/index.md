A child may learn how to perform a completely new behaviour such as how
to print various letters, or learn how to perform a new operation or
procedure such as long multiplication. A child may learn the name of a
new symbol such the chemical symbol "Fe" or the meaning of a new concept
such as "equals". These examples remind us that a variety of different
kinds of *acquisition* outcomes are possible.

We distinguish between different types of acquisition outcomes, not
because the learner's behaviour differs but because different sets of
learning conditions are necessary for the achievement of different kinds
of acquisition outcomes. The conditions which must be provided in order
to teach someone to swim are different from the conditions which must be
provided in order to teach someone to read. If we classify acquisition
outcomes according the kinds of learning experiences which are required
in order to bring them about, we discover that a number of different
kinds of acquisition outcomes need to be distinguished. The most common
of types of acquisition outcomes contained in primary school curricula
are: (1) the acquisition of new meanings, (2) the acquisition of new
behaviours, (3) the acquisition of new procedures, (4) the acquisition
of new equivalence relations, (5) the acquisition of new concepts and
generalisations and (6) the acquisition of new knowledge.

Different types of acquisition outcomes need to be distinguished for two
reasons, first because their achievement depends upon the presence of
different kinds of learning experiences and secondly because the
measurement of progress towards each of these types of outcomes requires
the use of different kinds of measurement procedures. The teacher,
teacher educator, or teaching researcher who fails to distinguish
between different types of acquisition outcomes will be unable to seek
out research into the most effective ways of helping children acquire
different kinds of skills and understandings and will be unable to
devise measurement procedures which they can use to monitor children's
acquisition of new skills and understandings.
