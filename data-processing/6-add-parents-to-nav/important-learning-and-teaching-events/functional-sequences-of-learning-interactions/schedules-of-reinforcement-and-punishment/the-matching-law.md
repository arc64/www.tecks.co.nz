Children and adults often find themselves in a situation where there are
several different responses which can be used to obtain a particular
type of reinforcement, that is, several different actions which can be
taken to achieve a particular goal. Past experience has taught the
individual that each of these actions works at least some of the time
(but not always). In this kind of situation the various actions which
can be taken are said to be on *concurrent intermittent schedules* of
reinforcement. This is one of the situations where we say that the
individual "has a choice." How are choices made in this kind of
situation? According to Richard Herrnstein, responses in this situation
are distributed according to what Herrnstein referred to as the
*Matching Law* (Herrnstein, 1961). "The matching law states that an
individual will distribute his or her behavior between alternatives in
the same ratio that reinforcements have been obtained for these
alternatives" (Myerson & Hale, 1984, p. 367).

An understanding of the effects on motivation and behaviour of the
matching law in situations where reinforcement is only intermittent is
essential for teachers and anyone who is involved in behaviour
management or the design of remedial interventions for inappropriate
behaviour. This is because interventions in which desirable behaviour is
reinforced on a richer variable ratio schedule than that produced by the
inappropriate behaviour will have the effect of motivating a complete
cessation of the inappropriate behaviour while interventions which do
not will be completely ineffective (Myerson & Hale, 1984, p. 369).
