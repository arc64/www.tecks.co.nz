The proportion of learner responses which are correct during practice
may vary from 0 to 100 per cent. This variable is often referred to as
the "error rate" but in this account we will refer to it as the accuracy
level since it is improvements in accuracy which we are primarily
interested in. The main way in which teachers manage the accuracy level
during instruction is by the use of prompting procedures of various
kinds.

The accuracy level during acquisition and practice is a very important
variable because variations in accuracy level have profound effects both
on rate of acquisition and on motivation. Compare for example, the
differences in rate of learning and in motivation which you would expect
to find after periods of practice in which the proportion of correct
responses was, say, 20%, 80% and 100%. Another reason why accuracy level
is important is because teachers disagree with respect to optimal
accuracy levels. Some writers counsel teachers to aim for high accuracy
levels during practice while other writers counsel teachers to use
discovery learning activities in which the accuracy level is inevitably
quite low. Barak Rosenshine (1983), for example, counsels teachers to
aim for an accuracy level of 80 to 85 per cent and teachers are
routinely counselled to select instructional reading materials which the
child can read with at least 85% accuracy to maintain motivation. These
accuracy levels are impossible to achieve using discovery learning
activities.
