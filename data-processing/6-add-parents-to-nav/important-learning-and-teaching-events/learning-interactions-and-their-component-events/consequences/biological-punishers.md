The biological punishers are those events which pose a threat to the
safety or comfort of the individual as a human being. They are events,
the avoidance of which are essential to the survival and comfort of all
individuals regardless of culture. The biological punishers include the
events (such as rotten food) which make us feel nauseous or ill, the
events (such as sudden movements) which startle us, the events (such as
aggression from others) which frighten us, and the events (such as
blows, cuts, stings and burns) which hurt us. The biological punishers
also include lack of air, foul air, extreme heat and extreme cold,
exertion without rest, the lack of sensory stimulation which we
experience as boredom, very loud noises and foul tastes and smells.

Much of what we do we do in order to avoid the punishing effects of
naturally occurring aversive events. For example, we avoid careless
behaviour on a bike or skates or skis in order to avoid the consequences
of falling over (hurting ourselves). Someone who accidentally touches a
hot element will burn themselves and the aversive consequence is
immediate and automatic. Someone who drinks too much at a party and
starts to feel nauseous will experience a biologically determined
aversive outcome which has resulted directly from the behaviour of
drinking too much.
