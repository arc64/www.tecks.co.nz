In teaching situations, one of the most commonly observed kinds of
antecedent stimulus events is the presentation of curriculum relevant
information to the learner. We will refer to messages which the learner
receives from the verbal environment as *presentations*. Presentations
always involve some kind of curriculum relevant content. They are always
about something. (In everyday language, the content of a presentation is
usually referred to as "information".) The information is not
information about what to do. It is information about the lesson
content, that is, it is curriculum relevant information which is being
presented in the hope that the learner will remember it.

Unlike practice stimuli and prompts, presentations can occur without any
practice response on the part of the learner. The only response which is
expected to a presentation is that the presentation be attended to by
the learner.

Presentations come in many forms: teacher or student talk, written
accounts, diagrams, pictures, television programmes, and so on. In
addition, presentations can differ in a number of important ways. They
may differ with respect to mode, content, and meaningfulness, for
example.
