In addition to the conditions which are necessary for fluency building,
there are several other variables which may operate to affect the rate
of progress towards a criterion level of fluency.

**1. When fluency building begins**

When should fluency building begin? Obviously fluency building cannot
begin until the learner has acquired the ability to respond correctly or
at least to respond correctly most of the time. However, experience
suggests that it is not necessary to wait until the learner can respond
correctly to every single item. Fluency building may begin before
completely correct responding has been achieved. "At about the time when
the child is making 20 or more correct movements during the assessment
with only half as many errors, we should consider a new program to
increase his fluency. . . . There is some evidence that, once a child
"gets the hang" of a basic skill, an emphasis on fluency will decrease
his errors almost as much as it increases his correct rate" (White &
Haring, 1980, p. 236). The general rule seems to be that fluency
building should begin as soon as possible. The sooner fluency building
begins, the sooner it will be achieved. Also, it is important that
fluency building begin as soon as possible so that the teacher does not
accidentally shape up accurate but slow responding (White & Haring,
1980).

**2. How fluent responding is prompted**

In order to shape more skilled responding we prompt skilled responding.
In order to shape correct responding, we prompt correct responding. In
order to shape fluent responding we must prompt fluent responding. This
can be achieved in a variety of ways. Sometimes the simple act of
introducing timed practice and telling the students that they are now
going to be timed is sufficient to produce considerable increases in
fluency (Rhymer, Henington, Skinner & Looby, 1999). Other prompting
procedures include the teacher modelling fluent performance, the teacher
drawing the learner's attention to the responding of a child who has
already mastered the target skill and the teacher directly requesting
faster responses, e.g. "Today, I want you to see how many you can get
right in two minutes", or "Hurry up or you will miss out on PE". Thirdly
the teacher can clearly describe the fluency aim, or draw the fluency
aim on the student\'s fluency progress graph (Smith & Lovitt, 1974; Van
Houten & Thompson, 1976).

**3. The extent to which slow responses are identified for additional
practice**

At each point during fluency building there will be some items which the
learner still responds to incorrectly from time to time and some items
which the learner takes longer to respond to than others. (This may be
because these items are more difficult or because the learner has had
less practice on these items than on others.) A number of unpublished
EDUC 330 student projects at the University of Canterbury have
demonstrated that, where some of the items are less well learned than
others, fluency development can be accelerated by providing extra
practice on these items. There are a number of practice procedures which
function to provide extra practice on the least well learned items.

-   If flash cards are being used, the items which the learner fails to
    respond to immediately (or fails to respond to correctly) can be
    returned to the pack one-fifth of the way down the pack instead of
    being placed at the back of the pack. This will function to provide
    additional practice on these items.
-   The least well learned items can be identified by the learner or by
    a peer during a timed test by underlining these items. Flash cards
    can be made up for these items for the learner to practise in his or
    her own time, or the learner can practise these items during fluency
    practice sessions for a few days before returning to practise on the
    complete set of items.
-   The learner can use a flash card fluency test, setting aside the
    cards which the learner cannot respond to immediately. Extra
    practice on these cards can be scheduled for the next few days.

Because the items which are least well known will differ from learner to
learner (as a function of differences in the practice histories of each
learner) it follows that fluency building will proceed more rapidly if
this practice is individualised. While group games and class practice
activities have an important role to play in providing variety during
practice, it will only be possible to provide additional practice on the
least well learned items if a high proportion of the fluency practice is
individualised.

**4. The way in which practice sessions are scheduled**

Regular short practices result in the most rapid development of fluency.
This means that, where fluency is the teaching aim, some fluency
building practice should be scheduled each day. In fact, some writers
(e.g. Kameenui & Simmons, 1990; White & Haring, 1980) suggest that
several fluency practices may be scheduled each day. Since fluency
building practices will normally be quite short (3 to 5 minutes), the
scheduling of these practices is a relatively simple matter. They can
simply be scheduled in between longer instructional tasks. The
scheduling of fluency practices is further simplified if each student
has their own individual set of flashcards or fluency building
materials. This enables individual students to engage in fluency
building practice whenever they have a minute or two to spare.

**5. The way in which increases in fluency are reinforced**

Although fluency building practice is not the most exciting form of
instructional activity most children enjoy the challenge of seeing how
fast they can respond. Interest can also be maintained by using a
variety of different kinds of practice activities (e.g. Church, Nixon,
Williams & Zintl, 2005). In addition to solitary practice, students can
work together in pairs or in groups "testing" each other. In addition to
practising on worksheets, students can practise using a variety of
different kinds of games. In addition to competing against oneself,
children who have achieved similar fluency levels can compete against
each other. "Given that practice can become boring, the teacher must put
forth an effort to make practice interesting or fun. Instructional
games, peer teaching, computer-assisted instruction, self-correcting
materials, and reinforcement are helpful in planning practice-to-mastery
activities" (Mercer & Miller, 1990, p. 23).

The rate of improvement during fluency building is also affected by the
strength of the reinforcement received for improvements in fluency.
While weak reinforcers may be sufficient to motivate some improvement,
the use of stronger reinforcers will motivate greater effort and more
rapid improvement. The strongest reinforcers are contingent access to
preferred activities, that is, access to activities which already
generate reinforcement for the student. In other words, faster rates of
improvement in fluency may be motivated by setting individualised,
intermediate fluency goals and by allowing the students who achieve
these goals to take part in the classroom activities which they like
best, the fluency building games and races which they like best, and the
recreational activities which they like best. "There is a very good
chance that simple feedback will not maintain the child's best efforts.
Be prepared, therefore, to institute some other program of consequation
if the child fails to accelerate in his correct movement rate. Tokens,
stars, lots of praise, or "math races" . . . might well make the
difference between a child becoming bored with the task . . . or
accelerating rapidly to the established fluency criterion" (White &
Haring, 1980, p. 237). Examples of how rapidly fluency can improve when
students are motivated by strong incentives have been provided by a
number of experiments (e.g. Church et al., 2005; Sandford, 1991).
