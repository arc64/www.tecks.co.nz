Much school learning involves the acquisition of new knowledge
responses. Unlike the acquisition of equivalence relations and
generalised correct responses where a response is only correct if it is
word perfect, knowledge responses are judged to be "correct" if the
*meaning* of the response matches the *meaning* of the original
proposition.

"Knowledge" can be expressed as a series of propositions. (e.g. "when
heat is added, ice changes to water"). In order to ascertain whether or
not a student has learned a particular proposition (item of information)
we can turn the proposition into a question. For example, "What happens
when ice is heated?" Like equivalence relations, the elements of
knowledge propositions, once learned, are reversible. The student who
can respond correctly the question "What happens when ice is heated?"
will almost certainly be able to answer the question "What do we have to
heat to produce water?"

It is often a requirement that the student be able to demonstrate an
understanding of the material which is being talked about. With
knowledge learning, understanding is demonstrated when the student
demonstrates that they can respond to questions about a proposition
which are *paraphrases* of the original proposition. In order to respond
correctly to a paraphrase question, the student must have understood and
remembered the meaning of the original presentation (and not just
memorised the words used in the original presentation).

Given the fact that knowledge learning is such a common classroom
teaching aim it comes as no surprise to find that there have been
thousands of studies of this kind of learning. Unfortunately, this
research has been singularly unsuccessful in identifying either the
conditions which affect knowledge learning or the teaching procedures
which result in the most rapid learning of new knowledge responses.

There are several reasons for this lack of progress. First, knowledge
learning researchers have yet to discover a *research* *method* which
can be successfully applied to study the knowledge learning process. One
of the problems which learning researchers face is that meaningful
knowledge responses tend to be acquired very quickly. During the 20th
century, learning researchers attempted to solve this problem by setting
students to learn relatively non-meaningful materials (e.g. Tulving &
Madigan, 1970). This had the effect of slowing down learning so that it
could be studied but it also generated results which could not be
applied to the classroom where teachers usually try to ensure that
knowledge learning tasks are as meaningful as possible.

The second procedure which learning researchers used in their attempts
to slow the knowledge learning process to the point where it could be
studied was to set the learner tasks which involved relatively large
numbers of knowledge responses, that is, a larger number of new
responses than could be acquired in the time available (Duchastel,
1983). This can be an appropriate strategy provided one studies the
learning of individual learners. It is necessary to study learners one
at a time because (a) each individual learner comes to a given knowledge
learning task with prior learning experiences which enable them to
answer some test questions before instruction even begins and (b) this
prior knowledge is different for each learner. Unfortunately however,
most knowledge learning researchers have chosen to study changes in the
mean test performance of groups of learners. Because each learner in a
group of learners already knows somewhat different things and, hence,
learns different things during a given knowledge learning task, the
results of these between group experiments have proved to be largely
uninterpretable.

Thirdly, a large proportion of the knowledge learning research studies
have been studies of students involved in independent study activities
of one kind of another (e.g., Andre, 1981; Andre & Womack, 1978). This
research has yielded interesting information about the study skills
which students bring to this kind of learning task but, because the
studies have not involved any kind of teaching or instruction, they have
not contributed to our understanding of how best to teach new knowledge
responses.

When the non-experimental studies, the between-group experiments, the
experiments involving non-meaningful materials, and the experiments
involving independent study rather than instruction are removed from the
research pool, almost no research is left. So far we have been able to
locate only about 60 controlled experimental analyses of knowledge
learning where the knowledge responses to be acquired have been
specified prior to the experiment. So what we actually know about how
best to teach new knowledge responses is based on a tiny corpus of
research.

Because individual items of meaningful information are very quickly
acquired, the primary problem in teaching new knowledge responses is not
so much a matter of how to teach them as it is a matter of deciding how
many knowledge responses should be taught at one time and of selecting
procedures which ensure that every student comes into contact with each
of the items of information which are to be learned and remembered.
