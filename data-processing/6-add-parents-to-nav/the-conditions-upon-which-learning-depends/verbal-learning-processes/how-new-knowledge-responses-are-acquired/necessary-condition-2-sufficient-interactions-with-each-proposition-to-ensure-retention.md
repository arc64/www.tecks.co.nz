There is no doubt that children can learn new knowledge from listening
to teacher talk and to the talk of other students (e.g. Doyle, Gast,
Wolery, Ault & Farmer, 1990; Gast, Doyle, Wolery & Kolenda, 1994).

It is also the case that almost any intervention which requires all
(rather than just one) of the students in a class or group to respond to
questions about knowledge topics results in a marked increase in the
amount remembered by participating students. Included under this heading
are experiments showing superior recall following lessons involving
response cards (Cavanaugh, Heward, & Donelson, 1996; Gardner, Heward &
Grossi, 1994), choral responding (Sterling, Barbetta, Heward & Heron,
1997), guided notes for students to complete (Hamilton, Siebert,
Gardner, Talbert-Johnson, 2000; Lazarus, 1991), classwide peer tutoring
(Utley, Reddy, Delquadri, Greenwood, Mortweet & Bowman, 2001),
cooperative learning groups (Maheady, Mallette, Harper & Sacca, 1991),
and guided discussion of key points (Lazarus, 1991; Wildman & Kelley,
1980).

How often does a knowledge proposition have to be heard or practised
before it will be remembered? Research by Graham Nuthall and Adrienne
Alton-Lee (Nuthall & Alton-Lee, 1992, 1993; Nuthall, 1999) provides the
beginning of an answer to this question. Nuthall and Alton-Lee tested
three upper primary school students before and after a series of lessons
and lesson activities on "Life in the Middle Ages" to identify those
test items which each student (a) answered incorrectly before the
lessons and (b) answered correctly after the lessons (i.e. the
propositions which had been both learned and remembered). They then went
back to their very detailed recordings of everything which the three
students had seen, heard and done during the course of the lessons and
counted the number of occasions on which each student had experienced
the remembered item of information (either by hearing it, seeing it,
saying it, or writing it).

They discovered that each of the three students learned and remembered
only those items of information which they experienced on at least four
occasions with no more than two days between any two of the four
experiences. The experience had to be with the complete proposition
although experience with definitions, analogies, examples and
non-examples could suffice provided that the pupil also experienced the
complete proposition on one or more occasions. The
four-experiences-within-two-days rule identified, with 82 per cent
accuracy, the items of information which were learned and remembered.
These results were replicated in two further studies: (a) a study of
four students who took part in a lesson on "Cultural Differences in New
York" (where the remembered items were predicted with 85 per cent
accuracy) and (b) a study of four students who took part in a lesson on
the weather (where the remembered items were predicted with 83 per cent
accuracy).

The Nuthall and Alton-Lee studies suggest that, in order for a new
knowledge response to be acquired and remembered, the learner must
experience the relevant item of information, in propositional form, on
at least four occasions and, furthermore, that there must be no more
than two days between each successive experience.

The Nuthall and Alton-Lee studies suggest that the mode of the
experience does not matter too much. The student may read the
information, hear it in a classroom lesson, tell it to another student,
write it down, answer a question about it, or ask a question and receive
an answer about it.

The four-times-and-no-more-than-two-days rule has several critical
implications for instruction. It means that students must come into
repeated contact with to-be-learned knowledge. It means that the timing
of practice and review is as important as the amount of practice. And it
means that new knowledge topics must be *small* enough for students to
actively review all of the to-be-learned knowledge propositions several
times over a period of a few days.

The results of the Nuthall and Alton-Lee research stand in marked
contrast to conventional classroom practice where lessons on a
particular topic generally aim to cover each important proposition once
during the course of the lesson.

The research described above identifies the amount of practice which
individual learners must experience with each of the to-be-learned items
in a knowledge learning topic. In a situation such as a classroom the
main difficulty which the teacher faces is the practical difficulty of
determining which learners have and which learners have not engaged in
this amount of practice. The simplest way of answering this question is
to provide the students with regular quizzes during the course of study
of a topic and to use these quizzes to identify those items of
information which individual students have learned and remembered and
those items of information on which further practice is required. This
procedure is particularly effective for those students who consistently
underestimate the amount of study required in order to learn and
remember new knowledge responses (Gettinger, 1989).
