Much learning, especially during the early years, involves learning what
particular symbols mean. Young English speaking children have to learn
the meaning of the word *dog*, young French speaking children must learn
the meaning of the word *chien*, and young German speaking children must
learn what the word *Hund* means. Initially it is the meaning of the
spoken words which must be acquired. Later the child will need to learn
the meaning of the written words. At the same time the child will also
need to learn the meanings of symbols such as the numbers *0* to *9*,
gestures such as an outstretched hand, facial expressions such as a
glare, signs such as the "female toilet" sign, markings such as a zebra
crossing, and so on.

The learning process which is involved in the acquisition of meaning has
long been considered to be something of a mystery and many fanciful
explanations have been advanced. The explanatory difficulty probably
arises as a function of human consciousness. Because consciousness
allows us to "visualise" the meanings of many words (such as *dog* or
*red* or *tall*) we are often seduced into thinking that meaning must be
a stimulus. If I can see something in my mind's eye (e.g. a red light)
in the same way that I can see a red light in the real world, then the
red light in my mind's eye must be a stimulus in the same way that the
red light in the real world is a stimulus which I can see and respond
to.

It is interesting to discover that an answer to the question of how best
to conceptualise "meaning" has been around since the 1950s (e.g.,
Mowrer, 1954; Staats & Staats, 1957). Arthur and Caroline Staats argued
that the image in my mind's eye is not a stimulus, it is a response.
"The basic concept is that any external stimulus to which the organism
is sensitive is actually eliciting in the organism a *sensory response*
(Staats, 1996, p. 65). Once we consider "comprehending the meaning of a
word" as a response, a relatively simple explanation of how words come
to acquire their meanings, and hence come to be "comprehended" or
"understood", becomes possible. "What is the purpose of this
distinction? Centrally, considering sensations as responses says that
they can be learned, that an organism can be conditioned to have a
sensory response. As a consequence of such conditioning, a sensory
response can be elicited by a stimulus other than the stimulus that
ordinarily arouses that sensation. Such a learned sensation, which
occurs in the absence of a sensory stimulus is, in commonsense terms,
called an image. . . . An image is a sensory response that has been
*conditioned* to some extraneous stimulus and can be elicited by that
stimulus (Staats, 1996, p. 65).

The conditioning process which Staats is referring to is respondent
conditioning. The respondent conditioning process is the process whereby
a stimulus such as a word which does not initially possess the power to
elicit a response can acquire that power simply by occurring at the same
time (or slightly before) a stimulus which has already acquired the
power to elicit the response.

Staats and his colleagues designed a number of ingenious experiments to
test the theory that meaningless words can acquire meaning through
respondent conditioning (Staats & Staats, 1957; Staats, Staats &
Crawford, 1962; Staats, Staats, Finley & Minke, 1953; Staats, Staats &
Heard, 1959, 1961; Staats, Staats, Heard & Nims, 1959). As a result of
these experiments Staats and Staats and their colleagues were able to
demonstrate that words probably acquire their meanings as a result of
respondent conditioning. The respondent conditioning of word meaning may
be pictured as shown in Figure 4110a.

![Figure 4110a. Sequence of events involved in a young child acquiring
the meaning of the spoken word "dog" as a result of
experience.](../../../../../assets/images/Figure4110a.png "Figure 4110a. Sequence of events involved in a young child acquiring the meaning of the spoken word “dog” as a result of experience."){.image-inline}

*Figure 4110a. Sequence of events involved in a young child acquiring
the meaning of the spoken word "dog" as a result of experience.*

Because the spoken word "dog" initially occurs repeatedly in the
presence of both pictures of dogs and real dogs (often accompanied by a
pointing response) and rarely at any other time, this repeated pairing
results in the spoken word "dog" acquiring the power to elicit a mental
image or mental response similar to that elicited by the animal itself.
That is, the spoken word comes to acquire its conventional meaning when
heard by the listener.

Staats and Staats were further able to demonstrate second order
conditioning. This refers to the way in which an initially meaningless
word can acquire meaning simply by occurring regularly in the same
context as another word or words which already have meaning. For
example, if the word "verb" regularly occurs in definitions which refer
to verbs as "doing words", or "action words", or "words which describe
what someone is doing" then this is the meaning that the word "verb"
acquires. This process may be pictured as shown in Figure 4110b.

![Figure 4110b. Sequence of events involved in a young child acquiring
the meaning of the spoken word "Hund" as a result of is association with
the spoken word
"dog".](../../../../../assets/images/Figure4110b.png "Figure 4110b. Sequence of events involved in a young child acquiring the meaning of the spoken word “Hund” as a result of is association with the spoken word “dog”."){.image-inline}

*Figure 4110b. Sequence of events involved in a young child acquiring
the meaning of the spoken word "Hund" as a result of is association with
the spoken word "dog".*

This process has been demonstrated several times. For example, Staats,
Staats & Heard (1961) selected 12 words that all elicited a "roundness"
image (like *globe, hoop, wheel* and *ball*) and another set of 12 words
that all elicited an "angularity" image (like *steeple, triangle,
diamond,* and *pyramid*). A meaningless nonsense syllable (e.g. YOF)
which was paired with each of the first set of words was subsequently
rated as more "round" by a sample of students than it was when paired
with each of the second set of words.

Second order conditioning explains how it is that we can develop a
mental picture of something which we have never seen (such as an
aadvark) simply as a result of reading verbal descriptions of the object
or event. Second order conditioning also explains how it is that words
like "ghost" and "ogre" (which have no material existence) can become
meaningful words. It also helps us to understand the mechanism whereby a
person might accept as real "the existence of various forms of witches,
hobgoblins, elves, dragons, spirits and so on" (Staats, 1968, p. 50).

Of course, the discovery that meaning responses (such as mental images)
function as responses does not negate the fact that they can also
function as stimulus elements in a chain of responses. Just as the
actual performance of one step in the preparation of a particular meal
can elicit the next step, so too can the sequence of mental images which
have been acquired as a result of previous experience in preparing that
meal.
