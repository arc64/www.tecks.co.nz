It is widely argued that teachers should reinforce improvements. This is
an entirely reasonable suggestion since, if reinforcement was withheld
until the learner achieved criterion performance, the learner would
often receive very little reinforcement.

This is especially true of those skills where the learner must acquire
new levels of motor coordination such as talking, walking, handwriting
and so on. Such skills are acquired only slowly and after considerable
practice. Such skills are normally "shaped", that is, practised under
conditions in which improvements in performance are differentially
reinforced. There are many controlled studies of shaping. Almost without
exception these studies demonstrate that new skills which require
considerable practice are acquired much more rapidly under conditions in
which *improvements* are reinforced rather than under conditions which
do not reinforce improvements (Allison, & Ayllon, 1980; Buzas & Ayllon
1981; Fitterling & Ayllon, 1983; Koop & Martin, 1983; Lahey, Busemeyer,
O\'Hara & Beggs, 1977; Shapiro, & Shapiro, 1985; Swanson, 1981; Sweeney,
Salva, Cooper. & Talbert-Johnson, 1993; Trap, Milner-Davis, Joseph &
Cooper, 1978; Ward, Crouch, & Patrick, 1998).

However, none of these studies have directly compared the effects of
reinforcing improvements versus reinforcing the achievement of criterion
performance. This means that we have yet to gain a clear idea of those
learning outcomes for which it is more effective to reinforce
improvements and those learning outcomes where it is more effective to
reinforce criterion levels of performance such as responding correctly.
