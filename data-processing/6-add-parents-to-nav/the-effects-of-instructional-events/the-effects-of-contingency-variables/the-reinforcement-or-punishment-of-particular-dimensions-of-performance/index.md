A response, behaviour or action which is in the process of being
acquired may vary along more than one dimension. The following examples
illustrate this fact.

-   Young children's naming responses may vary with respect to
    pronunciation and they may vary with respect to whether they are
    correct or not and consequences may be contingent on improvements in
    pronunciation, or accuracy, or both.
-   Goal shooting responses may vary with respect to force and with
    respect to accuracy and success may be contingent on improvements in
    accuracy, or force, or both.
-   Academic responding in the classroom may vary along a number of
    dimensions: time on task (academic engaged time), productivity (the
    amount of work completed), accuracy (the proportion of responses
    which are correct) and fluency (e.g., the number of correct
    responses per minute). Reinforcing (and punishing) consequences may
    be contingent on any one or more of these dimensions.

These examples remind us that we can reinforce each occurrence of
responses in a particular response class (e.g., complying) or we can
reinforce just those responses which meet certain dimensional
requirements (e.g., complying promptly).
