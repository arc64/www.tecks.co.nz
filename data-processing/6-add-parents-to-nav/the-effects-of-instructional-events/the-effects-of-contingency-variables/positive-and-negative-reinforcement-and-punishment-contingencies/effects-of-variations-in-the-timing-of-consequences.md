It is widely argued that that reinforcing consequences have their
strongest effect when they follow the target behaviour or performance
immediately rather than some time later (Alberto & Troutman, 1999). This
effect has been observed with respect to feedback (Alber & Walshe, 2004)
and with respect to rewards (Fowler & Baer, 1981; Mayhew & Anderson,
1980). It is also argued that the same is true for punishing
consequences (Abramowitz & O'Leary, 1990). Apart from these experiments,
however, this effect has been little studied in classroom settings or
with the kinds of learning outcomes which are of interest to teachers.

Where delay is unavoidable (as is the case with preferred activity
reinforcers) the practitioner is usually advised to bridge the gap
between performance and reinforcement using some kind of token
reinforcement system where the child can be reinforced with a token
(e.g. a checkmark or star on a chart) as soon as he or she has met the
performance criterion. The tokens are then traded at a later time for a
given amount of time in the preferred activity (e.g., Mayhew & Anderson,
1980).

However, delayed reinforcement can also have beneficial effects under
certain circumstances. For example, there are experiments which have
found that delayed (rather than immediate) reinforcement results in
better levels of maintenance (Mayhew & Anderson, 1980) and better
generalisation to new settings (Fowler & Baer, 1981) than immediate
reinforcement. However, these effects have yet to be studied in any
systematic fashion.
