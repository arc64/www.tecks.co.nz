A number of classroom experiments have shown rapid suppression of
disruptive behaviour and antisocial behaviour in 3- to 16-year olds as a
result of the introduction of a response cost contingency (Ramp, Ulrich
& Delaney, 1971; Salend & Allen, 1985; Simons & Wasik, 1973; Trice &
Parker, 1983). For example, Ramp et al. used a light on the child's desk
to signal to a 9 year old boy with severe behaviour problems that he was
engaging in a prohibited behaviour and that he had just lost a part of
his scheduled free time later in the day (Ramp et al., 1971).

The effects of a well designed response cost contingency for drifting
off task tends to motivate more rapid improvements in attention to task
than verbal reminders for drifting off task in primary school children
with behaviour problems (Pfiffner, O'Leary, Rosen & Sanderson, 1985).

It is possible for parents to provide the consequences for appropriate
and inappropriate behaviour in the classroom. These procedures are often
referred to as "school-home notes" because a note from the teacher is
used to report to parents on the extent to which the student has met
expectations in the classroom and the amount of reinforcement or
reinforcement time which has been earned. In general school-home note
schemes which include both an incentive for meeting expectations and a
penalty for inappropriate or antisocial behaviour in the classroom
result in faster and longer lasting improvements in attention to task,
work done, and standard of work than school-home notes which depend on
home incentives alone (Kelley & McCain, 1995; Rosén, Gabardi, Miller &
Miller, 1990).

However, there have been some cases where reinforcement interventions
have been found to be just as effective as response cost interventions
in motivating reductions in disruptive behaviour (e.g. McGoey & DuPaul,
2000).
