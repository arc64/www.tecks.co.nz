In Book 2 we identified and defined a number of instructional events
which are thought to affect motivation, learning, retention and the
development of likes and dislikes. These events included the various
types of presentations, prompts and practice opportunities which occur
within each learning interaction, and the various types of presentation,
prompting, practice, contingency management and scheduling operations
which occur during instructional sequences.

In this book we review the results of scientific research into the
effects of these events. Although this research is in its infancy, the
experimentation undertaken to date tells us much about the events which
do and do not play a critical role in the development of motivation,
learning, retention, likes and dislikes. In the reviews which follows we
will also identify a number of commonly occurring instructional events
about which little is known.
