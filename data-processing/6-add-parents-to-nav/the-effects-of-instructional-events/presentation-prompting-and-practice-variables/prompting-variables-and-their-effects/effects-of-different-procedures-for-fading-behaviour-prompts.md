In order to shape independent performance of a new response or skill,
any prompts which were used during the initial learning phase must be
removed so that the learner has the opportunity to engage in independent
practice (unprompted practice). It is widely argued that any prompts
which were initially required should be faded, that is, gradually
removed. Three prompt fading procedures have been the subject of
scientific analysis. These are delayed prompting, decreasing assistance
and increasing assistance.

Delayed prompting has been most extensively studied. More than 55
controlled experiments have used delayed prompting to teach a variety of
different kinds of responses and skills to both normally developing and
developmentally delayed learners ranging in age from preschoolers to
adults (e.g. Chandler, Schuster & Stevens, 1993; Doyle, Gast, Wolery,
Ault & Farmer, 1990; Kinney, Stevens & Schuster, 1988; Koscinski & Gast,
1993; McCurdy, Cundari & Lentz, 1990; Stevens & Schuster, 1987; Wolery,
Werts, Snyder & Caldwell, 1994). An analysis of the Pause-Prompt-Praise
tutoring procedure by Houghton and Glynn (1993) suggests that the
delayed prompting feature is a critically important part of the
procedure. Pause-Prompt-Praise is a reading tutoring procedure which has
been shown to accelerate reading development in a number of studies
(Glynn & McNaughton, 1985).

Following a review of the research into delayed prompting to 1988,
Stevens and Schuster (1988, p. 21) concluded that \"the time delay
procedure has proven effective in teaching many skills\.... The
procedure offers a nearly errorless learning experience by 'setting the
student up' to succeed. This procedure eliminates the failure cycle by
offering the student the correct response until the behavior is
performed independently\".

Which of the three fading procedures is most effective? The answer seems
to be that all three procedures, when used correctly, are effective.
There does not appear to be any research to suggest that one of the
three procedures is more effective than the others. What the research
does suggest is that delayed prompting is more *efficient* than
decreasing assistance (Miller & Test, 1989) and considerably more
efficient than increasing assistance (Bennett, Gast, Wolery & Schuster,
1986; Gast, Ault, Wolery, Doyle & Belanger, 1988; Wolery, Ault, Gast &
Doyle, 1990). A possible reason for the greater efficiency of delayed
prompting is suggested below.

There have been some exceptions to the above conclusion. For example
Hendrickson, Roberts and Shores (1978) found that simultaneous prompting
resulted in fewer errors and more rapid acquisition of unknown reading
words than delayed prompting in two normally developing 8-year old boys
and McDonnell and Ferguson (1989) observed that decreasing assistance
resulted in four teenagers learning two banking skills (use of an
automatic teller machine and cashing a cheque) with less practice than
was required when time delayed prompting was employed.

The three fading procedures are not all equally easy to use correctly.
All fading procedures require a certain amount of teacher skill. The
teacher must make an informed judgement about when to start fading her
prompts, a judgement which will only be accurate if it is made on an
individual child-by-child basis. The delayed prompting procedure is the
easiest to learn and to use. Even primary aged children have learned to
use it (e.g. Houghton & Glynn, 1993; Miracle, Collins, Schuster &
Grisham-Brown, 2001; Tekin & Kircaali-Iftar, 2002; Telecsan, Slaton &
Stevens, 1999; Wolery, Werts, Snyder & Caldwell, 1994). The increasing
assistance and decreasing assistance procedures are much more difficult
to learn and to use correctly. Because they are more difficult there is
much greater scope for them to be used inappropriately.

A common error of judgement with the increasing assistance procedure is
to use a weaker prompt (to provide less assistance) than the learner
actually requires. For example, a student may make a reading error on an
unknown word, the teacher may respond with a hint or some other kind of
weak prompt and the child may make a second error. The teacher who uses
increasing assistance and who makes this kind of mistake will generate
many more student errors than the teacher who is using delayed prompting
(or using increasing assistance more accurately). It is probably this
factor more than anything else which results in the reduced efficiency
of increasing assistance compared to other fading procedures.

A common error of judgement with decreasing assistance is to remove
assistance too quickly. Let us say, for example, that the teacher shows
a student how to perform a particular maths operation, the student
demonstrates performance of the procedure, and the teacher then sets the
student to independently work some further examples while she attends to
another child. Later it is observed that few of the independently worked
problems are correct because the student has forgotten part of the
procedure. If prompts are faded before the learner can respond
independently, errors will occur. It may be this factor which results in
the reduced efficiency of decreasing assistance compared to delayed
prompting.

The main advantage of the delayed prompting procedure is that the
learner has the opportunity from the outset to demonstrate independent
performance on those steps or items that she has already learned. This
means that the parent, peer tutor or teacher can clearly see whether or
not a prompt is necessary and can judge very accurately when prompting
is no longer required. This makes the premature removal of prompts, and
the use of unnecessary prompts, much less likely.
