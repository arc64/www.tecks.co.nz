It seems reasonable to assume that a learner is more likely to learn how
to do something new if practice responses closely resemble the terminal
performance which is being aimed for. For example, it seem reasonable to
assume that a student is more likely to acquire new spelling responses
if they engage in spelling (hear--\>write) practice than if they engage
in reading or working crossword puzzles or completing word find puzzles.

There has been a limited amount of research into this question. One line
of research has involved comparing the relative effectiveness of written
versus oral responses during the learning of new spelling words (e.g.
Bradley, 1981; Cuvo, Ashley, Marso, Zhang & Fry, 1995; Van Houten & Van
Houten, 1991) and new number facts (Skinner, Ford & Yunker, 1991).
Because of differences in experimental procedures, these experiments
allow of no clear cut conclusion. When lesson time is controlled,
students tend to make about twice as many oral responses as written
responses and to obtain higher levels of accuracy following practice
(Skinner et al., 1991). When responses are controlled students learn
about the same number of new responses but the "say the answer"
condition takes much less time (Cuvo et al., 1995; Van Houten & Van
Houten, 1991). However, Bradley (1981) reports that students who engaged
in cover-*write*-compare practice recalled many more spellings on a 4
week recall test than students who engaged in cover-*say*-compare
practice.

A second line of research has compared the relative effectiveness of
written spelling practice against reading the words (Van Daal & Van der
Liej, 1992) or listening to the words being spelled (Sears & Johnson,
1986). In both of these experiments, written practice resulted in the
students learning more correct spellings than reading or listening.

There appears to have been one experimental analysis of the common
practice of teaching the learner to recite the steps which are involved
in the performance of a new procedure (Jones, Ollendick & Shinske,
1989). The Jones et al. experiment, which involved groups of twelve 7-
to 10-year olds learning a fire evacuation procedure found that students
who practised the steps performed better on the post-test (mean=66) than
those who just engaged in verbal rehearsal (mean=12).
