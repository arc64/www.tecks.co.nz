The traditional classroom lesson -- in which the teacher asks a question
and calls upon a single child to respond -- rests on the assumption that
students learn as much from listening to a question-and-answer sequence
as they do from participating in that question-and-answer sequence.
Practical experience suggests that this is sometimes the case, and the
research on incidental learning indicates that even children with
intellectual disabilities can learn and remember quite a lot from simply
listening to the responses of others (Cromer, Schuster, Collins &
Grisham-Brown, 1998; Doyle, Gast, Wolery, Ault & Farmer, 1990; Gast,
Doyle, Wolery, Ault, & Kolenda, 1994).

However, it is also clear from the research into classroom participation
that there are many occasions where the onlookers in a classroom lesson
learn much less than they would if they were participants. For example,
when every child in the class is required to respond to every question
either in writing, or else by holding up a response card, they remember
more on end-of-lesson and end-of-unit tests than when the teacher adopts
the traditional practice of calling on just one student at a time (e.g.,
Church, 1976; Gardner, Heward & Grossi, 1994; Randolph, 2007). Overt
answering in the form of unison responding to every teacher question is
also required during the small group lessons of Direct Instruction and
this, it has been claimed, is one of the reasons for the accelerated
progress which almost always occurs when children move into Direct
Instruction classrooms (Adams & Engelmann, 1996).

The question which is not answered by these studies is the question of
whether the inferior acquisition of the onlookers in a traditional
lesson is due to their covert (rather than overt) responding or whether
it is due to the fact that there is no requirement to actually frame a
response to every question. At the present time it seems more likely
that that the superior acquisition which results when every child is
required to respond overtly is a function of the requirement to respond
(that is, increased task engagement) than it is to the requirement to
respond overtly (rather than covertly).
