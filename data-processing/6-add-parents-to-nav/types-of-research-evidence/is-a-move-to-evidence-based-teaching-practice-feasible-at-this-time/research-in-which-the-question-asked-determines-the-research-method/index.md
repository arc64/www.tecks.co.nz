Research begins with the selection of an appropriate question. Research
into learning and teaching begins with the selection of an appropriate
question about the conditions which are necessary in order to bring
about a particular kind of learning outcome in children at a particular
point in their development. The best questions are those which are based
on a detailed knowledge of what has and has not yet been discovered
about the conditions governing learning.

Once a worthwhile question has been selected, the next task is to select
an appropriate research method, that is, the research method which is
most likely to provide a believable answer to the question. In order to
make this decision we need to be very clear about the kinds of questions
which can and cannot be addressed by the various methods available. All
too often teaching researchers first select a research method (e.g. the
one that they learned about in their research methods course) and then
hunt around for a question which can be studied using that method. To
avoid this mistake, teaching researchers need to be very clear about the
questions which can and cannot be addressed by within-subjects,
randomised groups and ethnographic methods.
