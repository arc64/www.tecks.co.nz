There are many different kinds of theories about the relationship
between teaching and learning and some of these allow us to make
predictions about what works, and some do not. From a practitioner's
point of view, a theory which allows the teacher to make accurate
predictions is clearly a much more useful theory than one which does
not. Teachers need to be able to determine, from amongst the available
courses of action, those which are most likely to result in the
development of particular kinds of learning in particular kinds of
students.

This means that we need an answer to the question "Which of the many
approaches to research have actually succeeded in identifying
reproducible relationships between teaching and learning?" One way of
answering this question is to identify the extent to which each of the
main approaches to research has succeeded in developing a coherent
theory of learning and teaching, that is, a set of empirically validated
"principles" which can be used to make predictions about the effects of
different kinds of teaching events on particular kinds of learning
outcomes and/or to make predictions about the conditions under which
different kinds of learning are, and are not, likely to occur.
