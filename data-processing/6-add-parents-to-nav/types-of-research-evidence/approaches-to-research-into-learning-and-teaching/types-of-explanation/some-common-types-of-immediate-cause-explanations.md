The most common types of immediate cause explanation found in the
educational and psychological research literature are intentional
explanation, dispositional explanation, and mechanistic explanation.

**Intentional explanations***.* Sometimes researchers attempt to explain
behaviour change in terms of the wishes, desires or intentions of the
learner. Such explanations are quite common in everyday language and are
often accepted as adequate explanations. "'I decided to take a short
walk' is accepted as an explanation of why you were seen at the beach at
midnight" (Hospers, 1990, p. 163). Intentional explanations are also
referred to as purposive explanations, teleological explanations,
interpretive explanations, and hermeneutical explanations. Researchers
who favour intentional explanations tend to argue that people are
impelled by ideas, knowledge, hopes, wants, desires, intentions, and so
on, and that to understand (that is, explain) actions, the investigator
must uncover the purpose of these actions, how the actors interpret the
situations they are in, and how they see the options which are open to
them (given their social beliefs).

**Dispositional explanations***.* Sometimes researchers attempt to
explain behaviour changes by referring to certain presumed
characteristics, traits, or dispositions of the learner. This kind of
explanation is extremely common in everyday discourse (e.g., "She is
making rapid progress in maths because she is highly motivated") and
almost as common in psychology. "We tend to account for the behaviour of
others by appealing to their dispositional characteristics such as
moods, attitudes, motivations, hopes, or expectations" (Hineline, 1992,
p. 1278). Someone who is observed to be working hard is said to being
doing so because they are "motivated". Someone who is doing very little
is said to be lethargic because they are "depressed".

**Mechanistic explanations***.* Sometimes researchers attempt to
describe a particular behaviour change by referring to events which
occurred immediately prior to instances of the new behaviour (e.g.,
"Following this flash of insight, Alex quickly solved the problem").
Explanations which refer to immediately preceding events or forces which
are acting on the individual are most commonly referred to as
*mechanistic explanations*. A mechanistic explanation may be given in a
physical vocabulary. Chiesa (1992) gives the following example:
administration of a drug is followed by a change in the constitution of
blood, which is followed by a change in the activity of nerve endings,
which is followed by a reduction in pain. More commonly, however,
mechanistic explanations in psychology are given in a non-physical
vocabulary. This is true of all immediate cause explanations which are
couched in terms of information processing, cognitive processes, memory
processes, and mental structures.

Mechanistic explanation has a long history in educational psychology. It
was the form of explanation favoured by Watsonian behaviourists.
"Classical behaviorism took a mechanistic or materialistic view of
psychology . . . and conceptualized the data language of psychology in
terms of stimulus-response units (Simkins, 1969, p. 39). Modern day
descendants of the classical behaviourists, the cognitive scientists,
employ a closely similar type of explanation. The effect of past
experience is to leave a trace, a representation, or a memory in the
mind so that when the learner faces a similar problem, the mind is
activated and the response recalled, with the mental recall producing
(causing) the correct response. Cognitive theories are basically
stimulus-response theories to which have been added some kind of
mediating mental process. The mediating mental process functions to
bridge the gap between an earlier experience (stimulus input) and a
later behaviour (response output) (Chiesa, 1992, p. 1290).
