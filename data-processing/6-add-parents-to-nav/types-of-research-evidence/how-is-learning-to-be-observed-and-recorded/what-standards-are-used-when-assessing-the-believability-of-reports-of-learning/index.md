"Whenever we observe something, we make errors; period, no exceptions,
ever" (Dane, 1990, p. 28). Given that all measurement procedures are
prone to error, it follows that the believability of a set of
observations in going to depend upon the extent to which measurement
errors were avoided. The believability of a set of observations of
learning (or teaching) depend in part upon the reliability of the
observation or testing procedures used, in part upon the accuracy of the
data obtained, and in part upon the validity of the conclusions which
the researcher has drawn from the data which was collected.

Without believable data, the researcher will be unable to draw
believable conclusions. Unfortunately, the collection of believable data
is no simple matter because educational researchers have yet to agree
upon a common set of standards which can be applied in assessing the
quality of research data - with ethnographers, social scientists and
behaviour analysts all applying different standards.

In this section we describe the data quality standards which are widely
applied during research into learning and teaching, some of the ways in
which data quality can be compromised, the steps which educational
researchers often take in order to enhance the believability of their
data, and the main procedures which are used when evaluating data
quality and believability.
