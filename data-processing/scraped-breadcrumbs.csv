            The problem to be solved
         
    

","The teaching activities which occur in classrooms have changed little during the past 80 years – a fact which has been documented many times.  Compare this with the very considerable scientific and technological advances which have occurred in almost all other professions during the 20th century. Unlike medical practice, where the traditional craft philosophy of patient care was gradually replaced by the revolutionary new clinical science during the first half of the 20th century, teaching practice has remained, to this day, a craft largely untouched by the scientific research on learning and teaching.

            Important learning and teaching events
         
    

",Distinctions between the events which do (and do not) affect learning are absolutely critical if we are to develop a science of learning and teaching.  Little or no progress was made in any of the established sciences until the “basic units” of the subject matter had been identified.

            Types of research evidence
         
    

",It is increasingly being argued that teaching practice should be evidence based.  But there are many different kinds of research into learning and teaching and this claim (that teaching should be evidence based) only becomes meaningful if we say what kind of research evidence we are talking about.

            The conditions upon which learning depends
         
    

","Central to any research base for teaching is the research into how learning occurs, that is, research into the conditions necessary for learning.  The first thing which we discover when examining the scientific research into learning is that learning does not involve a single process.  The term “learning” refers to a collection of processes: respondent learning processes, motivational processes, the processes involved in the acquisition of new performance skills, verbal learning processes, social learning processes and so on.  Research into the conditions necessary for learning shows that that the conditions necessary for learning differ from one learning process to the next. "

            The effects of instructional events
         
    

","In Book 2 we identified and defined a number of instructional events which are thought to affect motivation, learning, retention and the development of likes and dislikes.  These events included the various types of presentations, prompts and practice opportunities which occur within each learning interaction, and the various types of presentation, prompting, practice, contingency management and scheduling operations which occur during instructional sequences.

            Is a move from craft- to evidence-based practice possible?
         
    

","The suggestion that we should begin the transition from craft-based teaching practices to evidence-based teaching practices rests on the central assumption that there exists a tradition of scientific research into learning and teaching together with a corpus of research findings which are directly relevant to improving the effectiveness of current classroom practice.  Embedded in this assumption are two important questions.  First, is the scientific research into the conditions necessary for learning sufficiently advanced to be used in guiding design experiments aimed at the development of more effective teaching procedures?  Secondly, is the research on teaching sufficiently advanced to enable the development of evaluation procedures which will enable teachers to distinguish between effective and ineffective teaching procedures and programmes?

            The transition from craft to science
         
    

","Discovering that there is a very considerable tradition of scientific research in child development, in basic learning processes, and in the relative effectiveness of many commonly used teaching procedures does not mean that the transition from craft to science in teaching practice has begun or will now begin. The change from craft to science in medical practice required the presence of a number of social conditions and took the better part of 70 years.  A similar transition in teaching practice is likely to take a similar amount of time and is unlikely to occur until certain conditions are met.  Some of the conditions which appear to be necessary for a transition from craft to scientific practice in classroom teaching include the following."

            Learning processes, learning outcomes and phases of learning
         
    

","The scientific study of learning becomes possible only when investigators reach agreement on the nature of the subject matter, that is, the nature of the changes which are to be referred to as “learning”.  Since the main purpose of teaching is to facilitate or bring about learning, it follows that teachers, teacher educators, and teaching researchers must also have a very clear understanding of just what it is that we are referring to when we talk about “learning”.

","It is only possible to seek answers to questions about the conditions affecting learning if we have an answer to the question “learning what?”  Similarly it is only possible to seek answers to questions about the effects of particular teaching strategies on student learning if we have an answer to the question “teaching what?”  This is because, as we saw in the preceding chapter, there are many different types of learning outcomes and the development of each of these types of learning outcomes depends upon the provision or existence of different sets of instructional conditions.

English includes learning to interpret visual and oral presentations, learning to read, learning to make spoken and visual presentations, and learning to write. Mathematics includes the development of conceptual understanding, operational fluency and problem solving skills in number, algebra, geometry, measurement and statistics.  "

","In this section we identify some of the main events which learning depends upon.  These events have been the subject of scientific study for the better part of 100 years and, as a result it is possible to describe them with some confidence.  The main problem which still faces learning researchers is the problem of deciding upon the level of specificity/generality which should be used when describing and analysing different kinds of learning."

            Functional sequences of learning interactions
         
    

","Chapter 4 described the important components of a single learning interaction, the various values which these components can take, and the varied functions which each can perform. Of course, very little is learned as a result of a single learning interaction.  New skills and understandings develop as a function of experiences which consist of a number of learning interactions distributed over time.  In order to develop an understanding of what the word “yellow” means, the young child must experience many learning opportunities with yellow objects.  These may be spread out over several months."

","When learning and teaching are occurring in schools, learning depends not only on the variables referred to in earlier sections of this chapter but also on a number of additional variables related to the fact that teaching is occurring in the group setting of the classroom.  When teaching has to be carried out with groups of 25 to 30 learners simultaneously the effects of that teaching depend upon many additional factors: the teacher’s ability to translate vaguely stated curriculum objectives into specific lesson objectives, variability with respect to what the learners have learned already, variability in children’s ability to tutor each other, the teaching resources which are available to the teacher, the extent to which these resources enable the teacher to meet the learning needs of individual children, and so on."

            Approaches to research into learning and teaching
         
    

",Chapter 1 consists of 5 sections.  Section 1 identifies the most common approaches to research in education.  Section 2 examines the extent to which each of these approaches to research have learning and/or teaching as their primary subject matter.  Section 3 examines the units of analysis which are being used in research into learning.  Section 4 identifies the different types of explanation which are possible and Section 5 asks which of the several approaches to the study of learning and teaching is most likely (a) to identify the conditions necessary in order for different kind of learning to occur and hence most likely (b) to identify the teaching procedures which are effective in developing different kinds of learning outcomes in different kinds of learners

            How is learning to be observed and recorded?
         
    

","In order to study the conditions necessary for learning, or the effects of teaching on learning, the very first problem to be solved is the problem of how to observe learning and how to measure the rate at which learning is occurring.  Solving this problem requires the student of learning to make important decisions about what is to be observed, how it is to be observed, and the level of accuracy which will be aimed for. "

            How are the effects of teaching on learning to be measured?
         
    

",Once the learning researcher or teaching researcher has developed an accurate and reproducible measure of learning it becomes possible to seek the answer to many interesting questions.  For example learning researchers may seek the answer to questions such as “What are the conditions which must be provided in order for students with achievement level “z” to learn and remember how to do “y”? Teaching researchers may seek the answer to questions such as “What is the effect of teaching procedure “a” on the rate of acquisition of skill “b” in children with achievement level “c”?

            Is a move to evidence-based teaching practice feasible at this time?
         
    

","It is increasingly being argued that “teaching should be based on research” (e.g. Darling-Hammond & Bransford, 2005; Kameenui, Carnine, Dixon, Simmons & Coyne, 2002). However, education researchers sometimes ask cause and effect questions and sometimes do not, sometimes use an appropriate research method to examine questions about learning and teaching and sometimes do not, and sometimes collect believable data about the effects of teaching on learning and sometimes do not.  This variability in the research methods which are being used to study learning and teaching gives rise to all sorts of methodological debates and all sorts of questions about whether a move to evidence-based teaching practice is feasible at this time.  In this chapter we examine some of these questions from the point of view of what has, and has not, been achieved to date.  "

            Respondent processes
         
    

",The scientific research into learning has involved the study of a number of different learning processes.  One of the earliest lines of investigation was investigation into a learning process which has come to be known as respondent conditioning.  Respondent conditioning is also referred to as classical conditioning (because it was the first learning process to be systematically studied) and as Pavlovian conditioning (because it was first studied by the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov).

            Motivational processes
         
    

","The concept of motivation has had a chequered history in psychology and, as a result, has accrued many different meanings.  Frequently the term motivation is used to refer to some kind of biological force or internal state, an internal state which directs behaviour and governs the degree of effort which the learner is willing to put into particular tasks. In this book we will use the term motivation to refer to the level of effort which a learner is observed to be putting into completing a particular task or activity without making any inferences about the learner’s inner state. This will enable us to measure motivation by measuring productivity, that is the work accomplished while completing particular tasks or while engaged in particular classes of activity. "

","Most research into the conditions affecting learning has been research into acquisition.  Here too, the conditions which are necessary for learning depend upon the type of competency which the learner is attempting to acquire.  Acquisition outcomes may be grouped into two general classes: (a) the acquisition of new behaviours and motor skills of various kinds, and (b) the acquisition of competencies which are primarily verbal or conceptual.  In this section we will attempt to identify the conditions which are necessary for the acquisition of new performance and motor skills of various kinds.  "

In addition to acquiring a wide variety of performance skills, human learners also acquire a wide variety of verbal and conceptual behaviours and skills.  "
