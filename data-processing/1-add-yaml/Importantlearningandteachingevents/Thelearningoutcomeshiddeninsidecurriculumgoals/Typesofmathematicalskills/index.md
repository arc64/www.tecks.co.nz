Mathematical terms, concepts, operations, and generalisations are
hierarchically interrelated (Resnick, Wang and Kaplan, 1973). Some of
the hierarchical relationships which must be understood in order to plan
sequences of mathematics instruction have been analysed and described by
Evans, Evans and Mercer (1986), Silbert, Carnine and Stein (1990) and
Underhill, Uprichard and Heddens (1980) among others. The Silbert et al.
(1990) analysis is the most detailed of the analyses currently
available.

Early mathematics development involves the acquisition of a number of
component skills: mastering the equivalence relations of mathematics,
developing an adequate understanding of mathematical concepts, learning
how to perform a variety of mathematical procedures (operations), and
learning when it is appropriate to use each of these operations.
