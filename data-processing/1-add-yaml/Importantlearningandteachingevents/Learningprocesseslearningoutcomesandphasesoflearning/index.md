The scientific study of learning becomes possible only when
investigators reach agreement on the nature of the subject matter, that
is, the nature of the changes which are to be referred to as "learning".
Since the main purpose of teaching is to facilitate or bring about
learning, it follows that teachers, teacher educators, and teaching
researchers must also have a very clear understanding of just what it is
that we are referring to when we talk about "learning".

Most conventional definitions of learning refer to a phenomenon which
(1) involves change, (2) occurs in individuals, and (3) involves a
change in behaviour as well as a change in the central nervous system.
In Section 1 we explore some of the implications of this definition for
the observation and measurement of learning.

In addition, the term "learning" is used to refer to many different
kinds of change and each of these different kinds of change are
dependent upon the presence of a rather different set of conditions. In
Section 2 we identify some of these different kinds of changes: changes
in competency, changes in motivation, and changes in likes and dislikes.

Section 3 looks in greater detail at changes in competency and
identifies a number of different kinds of acquisition outcomes which
need to be distinguished because each is dependent upon the presence of
a somewhat different set of conditions before they are likely to occur.

Finally, we observe that all types of acquisition move through several
phases on the way from initial acquisition to mastery and long term
retention. These phases are described and defined in Section 4.
