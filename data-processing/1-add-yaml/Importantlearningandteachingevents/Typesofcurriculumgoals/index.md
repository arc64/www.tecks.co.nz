It is only possible to seek answers to questions about the conditions
affecting learning if we have an answer to the question "learning what?"
Similarly it is only possible to seek answers to questions about the
effects of particular teaching strategies on student learning if we have
an answer to the question "teaching what?" This is because, as we saw in
the preceding chapter, there are many different types of learning
outcomes and the development of each of these types of learning outcomes
depends upon the provision or existence of different sets of
instructional conditions.

What it is that children are expected to learn while they are at school
is set out in state or national curriculum documents. While the school
curricula of individual countries contain much in common, especially
during the early years, there is also considerable variability in
national curricula from one country to the next. This variability
complicates the scientific study of learning and teaching by introducing
variability with respect to the learning outcomes which are being
selected for study and analysis. For example, studies of learning to
read in countries where the teaching of reading is introduced at age 5
(an age when many children have yet to acquire the level of phonemic
awareness necessary for learning to read) inevitably involve a different
set of considerations than is the case in countries where learning to
read is introduced at age 7 (after most children have acquired the level
of phonemic awareness necessary for success in learning to read).

In this chapter we will examine a sample of the achievement objectives
listed in the New Zealand curriculum documents and address the question
of whether any of these achievement objectives are given in sufficient
detail for them to be of use in designing a teaching programme, or in
monitoring student progress, or in studying the effects of teaching on
learning in the classroom.
