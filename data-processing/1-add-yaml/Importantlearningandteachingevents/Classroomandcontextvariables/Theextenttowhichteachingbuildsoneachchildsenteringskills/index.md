The learners who arrive at a particular classroom invariably arrive with
a wide diversity of previously acquired beliefs, knowledge,
understandings and skills. These previously acquired skills are often
referred to as *entering skills*. It is widely assumed that instruction
must be developmentally appropriate, that is, it must build upon those
skills which have already been acquired, while at the same time
requiring the application of only those skills which have been acquired
already. It can be seen therefore, that the entering skills of the
learner combine with the choices made by the teacher to determine
whether or not a particular learning activity will provide the
opportunity for the learner to acquire additional skills or increased
levels of proficiency.

In this account, those entering skills which are *assumed* by a sequence
of learning activities will be referred to as *prerequisite skills*.
Note that prerequisite skills are only prerequisites in the sense that
the teacher is assuming that they have been learned already. They are
*not* prerequisites in the sense that the new skill can\'t be learned
until the prerequisite skill has been mastered. Independent reading can
only be considered a prerequisite skill if the teaching method for a new
topic involves reading. New knowledge can still be acquired by a student
who cannot read. It can be acquired by instructing the learner orally.
So reading is not a *necessary* prerequisite for knowledge learning in
the sense that the learner has to be able to read before she can learn
new knowledge responses.
