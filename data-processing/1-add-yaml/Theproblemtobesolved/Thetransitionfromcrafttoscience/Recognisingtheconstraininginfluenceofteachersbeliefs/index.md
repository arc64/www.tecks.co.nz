In order to introduce elements of evidence-based practice into the
classroom, the classroom teacher must first come to believe that
research has something to offer. Outside those teaching in special
education, it would be true to say that few classroom teachers believe
that the scientific research into learning and teaching has anything
much to say about the way in which children might be most effectively
taught. Some teachers simply have no contact with the scientific
research into learning and teaching so they have no knowledge of more
effective ways of teaching the children in their classrooms. Some
teachers and teaching researchers believe that scientific research into
learning and teaching is simply not possible. Some believe that the
research to date is largely irrelevant to classroom teaching. Even when
teachers discover interesting research findings, these findings may be
rejected because they are contrary to a belief which is widely shared
within the teaching profession.

*Lack of contact with the scientific research on learning and teaching*

Teachers read few if any books or journals on research and developments
in education (Wheldall, 2005) and surveys of school teachers' and school
principals' knowledge of research findings indicate that their knowledge
of advances in research-based knowledge is relatively limited (Biddle &
Saha, 2002). This is hardly surprising given that pre-service education
to date has been primarily craft based rather than research based.
However it does pose a very substantial impediment to any transition to
evidence-based practice. While it is conceivable that evidence-based
practices could be introduced into the classroom by including them in
pre-service programmes, this is unlikely to happen as long as teacher
educators are recruited from the ranks of practising teachers who
themselves have had almost no contact with the empirical research into
learning and teaching.

*The belief that scientific research into learning and teaching is
impossible*

A significant number of teaching researchers continue to argue that
scientific research into learning and teaching is simply not possible.
"The interpretive-idealist approach to research rejects the possibility
that laws will ever be found" (Smith, 1983, p. 12). This position is
often justified by arguing that teaching is too complex to study in a
scientific manner. "Human relationships are caught up in such an
interacting web of factors, events, and processes that the hope that
'the' cause-effect chain can be sorted out is vain" (Guba & Lincoln,
1997, p. 87). If cause and effect relations cannot be identified then it
follows that prediction is not possible. In other words it follows that
it will not ever be possible to design any kind of instructional
programme which will have a predictable effect.

The interpretive research methodology is fairly widely taught in schools
of education so a significant minority of teachers have come to believe
that scientific research into classroom practice is not possible.
Teachers who believe that scientific research is not possible are not
likely to go looking for such research and, hence, are unlikely to
discover the existence of the considerable body of scientific research
which is directly relevant to classroom practice and unlikely to
discover that there are teaching procedures and programmes which have
highly predictable effects across particular populations of children.

Interestingly, this belief cannot account for the fact that classroom
practice has remained largely unchanged for the better part of a
century. Interpretive research did not become popular amongst teacher
educators until the mid 1970s and did not begin to be incorporated into
teacher education programmes until the 1990s so this development cannot
be used to explain why teacher educators have shown little or no
interest in scientific research into learning and teaching for most of
the preceding century.

What the existence of this belief does do is to remind us that it will
not be possible to improve classroom practice simply by disseminating
the results of scientific research to teachers and teacher educators.
The beliefs and the teaching practice of a teacher who believes that the
scientific study of teaching is not possible are not going to be changed
by drawing that teacher's attention to the results of scientific studies
of teaching (Sykes, 1999).

*The belief that research into learning and teaching is largely
irrelevant to classroom practice*

A significant proportion of teachers and teacher educators believe that
educational research is largely irrelevant to classroom teaching. Many
teachers "view research knowledge as irrelevant, contradictory,
inaccurate, and too far removed from the classroom" (Malouf & Schiller,
1995, p. 417). It is not difficult to work out the reason for this
scepticism. An unselected reading of the research into teaching appears
to most people (including teachers) as a disorganised mess of
pseudo-scientific writing about investigations in which almost
everything is contested -- how learning should be measured, what counts
as an appropriate research method, the methodological assumptions which
should be made, how results should be interpreted, and even the results
themselves (Richardson, 2002).

Should teachers take into account children's learning styles, for
example, or is "learning styles" a useless construct which is unrelated
to anything? Can learning and teaching be studied using self-reports
(rather than direct observation) or are such efforts doomed to failure
because human beings are unable to accurately recall the hundreds of
separate learning interactions that are involved in the acquisition of
even a single new competency? Is it appropriate to average test scores
over a number of learners or is this kind of research doomed to failure
because learning involves a transition and a single test catches some
learners prior to this transition, some learners during the transition,
and some learners after they have already made the transition? If
professional researchers cannot sort out these disagreements then
teachers certainly should not be expected to (Landrum & Tankersley,
2004).

To illustrate the current situation in educational research, Diane
Ravitch (1998) imagines what would have happened if the doctors who
attended to her following her admission for a pulmonary embolism had
been replaced by educators.

The physicians who hovered over me dissolved, replaced in my mind's eye
by an equal number of education experts. ... my new specialists began to
argue over whether anything was actually wrong with me. A few thought
that I had a problem, but others scoffed and said that such an analysis
was tantamount to "blaming the victim." Some challenged the concept of
"illness" claiming that it was a social construction ... Others rejected
the evidence of the tests used to diagnose my ailment ... Among the
raucous crowd of education experts, there was no agreement, no common
set of standards for diagnosing my problem. They could not agree on what
was wrong with me, perhaps because they did not agree on standards for
good health.

Education researchers have been arguing amongst themselves with respect
to how learning should be measured and how the effects of teaching
should be evaluated for more than 80 years. Given that teaching
researchers (across the various disciplines) have developed no agreed
procedure for measuring the effects of teaching on learning it is hardly
surprising that huge tracts of the research on teaching are
uninterpretable, ungeneralisable, and even incomprehensible. And it is
hardly surprising that teachers who come into contact with this
amorphous, disorganised and unsorted research literature are left with
the impression that it has nothing useful to say about the conduct of
their work as teachers.

Until the research on teaching is stripped back to reveal the empirical
studies which have used valid and reliable measures of student learning
and valid and reliable measures of the effects of teaching on learning
(Church, 1992a, 1992b), the knowledge contained in this research will
remain hidden beneath the mountain of pre-scientific research.

One of the purposes of this website is to reveal to teachers, teacher
educators, and teaching researchers that there is far more scientific
research into the conditions necessary for learning and far more
controlled research into the relative effectiveness of different
teaching practices and procedures than they are aware of. Not only is
this research developing rapidly but it also speaks directly to many of
the problems which teachers face from day to day -- problems which could
be solved by a move towards evidence-based practice.
