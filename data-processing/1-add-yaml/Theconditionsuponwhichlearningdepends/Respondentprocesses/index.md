The scientific research into learning has involved the study of a number
of different learning processes. One of the earliest lines of
investigation was investigation into a learning process which has come
to be known as *respondent conditioning*. Respondent conditioning is
also referred to as *classical conditioning* (because it was the first
learning process to be systematically studied) and as *Pavlovian
conditioning* (because it was first studied by the Russian physiologist
Ivan Pavlov).

Respondent conditioning has turned out to be an extremely important
learning process because it is the learning process whereby we acquire
an understanding of the *meaning* of words, phrases, objects, events,
and so on. It is also the process whereby anxieties and fears, likes and
dislikes, attitudes and feelings are acquired. So this makes it a
particularly important learning process as far as classroom practice is
concerned, and one which needs to be understood by teachers at all
levels.
