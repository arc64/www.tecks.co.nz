Most research into the conditions affecting learning has been research
into acquisition. Here too, the conditions which are necessary for
learning depend upon the type of competency which the learner is
attempting to acquire. Acquisition outcomes may be grouped into two
general classes: (a) the acquisition of new behaviours and motor skills
of various kinds, and (b) the acquisition of competencies which are
primarily verbal or conceptual. In this section we will attempt to
identify the conditions which are necessary for the acquisition of new
performance and motor skills of various kinds.

There are two general classes of performance outcomes which need to be
distinguished: (a) the acquisition of completely new behaviours and
skills (that is, behaviours which have never been performed before) and
(b) the acquisition of new procedures, operations, and competencies
which involve the recombination of previously acquired skills. In this
section and the section which follows we will attempt to identify the
conditions which are necessary for (a) the acquisition of completely new
behaviours and (b) the acquisition of new procedures and operations.
