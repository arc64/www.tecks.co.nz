Just as access to a desired activity will function as a reinforcing
consequence, so loss of access to a desired activity will function as an
aversive consequence. Let us say for example, that a particular child
completes more work when work completion allows that child to work with
her friend. This observation suggests that working with the friend is
reinforcing for this pupil. If this is the case, then we can expect that
loosing the right to work with the friend will function as an aversive
consequence for this pupil and this is what happens (Lovitt, Lovitt,
Eaton & Kirkwood, 1973).

The two most commonly used and most widely studied punishment operations
are the response cost operation and the time-out operation. Response
cost refers to the removal of a certain amount of previously earned or
previously scheduled reinforcement or time in reinforcement as a penalty
for engaging in a particular prohibited behaviour. Response cost, like
all fining operations, functions as a punishment contingency only as
long as the learner has reinforcement, or reinforcement time to lose.
Time out is short for *time out from reinforcement* and refers to loss
of access to the currently reinforcing activity as a penalty for
engaging in a particular prohibited activity. Time out only functions as
a punishment contingency if the child is engaged in, or is about to
engage in, an activity which is a desired activity or high probability
activity as far as he or she is concerned.
