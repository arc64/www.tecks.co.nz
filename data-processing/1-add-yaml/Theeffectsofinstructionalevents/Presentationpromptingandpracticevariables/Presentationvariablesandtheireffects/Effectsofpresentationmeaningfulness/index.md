It is widely believed that the content of a meaningful presentation,
that is a presentation which consist of words that are understood by the
learner, is more likely to be remembered than the content of a
presentation which are not completely understood by the learner. There
is some research which supports this belief. For example, Marks,
Doctorow & Wittrock (1974) found that the substitution of one familiar
word for one unfamiliar word (e.g. \"religious leader\" for \"shaman\")
in each sentence of a reading text in common use in schools \"increased
story comprehension an amazing 50 per cent and retention an amazing 100
per cent. \...The familiar words make things more meaningful for
students\" (Gage & Berliner, 1988, p. 295).

Of course, it is not always possible for a presentation to be completely
meaningful. If the teacher is introducing a new concept, the concept
name may not be meaningful initially. Considerable discussion of the
concept's definition and of concept examples and non-examples may be
necessary before the new name acquires meaning.
