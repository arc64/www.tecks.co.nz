Research is always research into something. Research always has a
subject matter. The term *subject matter* refers to the events, the
classes of activities, or the phenomena which are of interest to the
investigator. Clearly, a particular approach to research will only be of
use to students of learning and teaching if it includes learning
phenomena and/or teaching phenomena within its subject matter. The first
question which needs to be addressed, therefore, is the question of
whether each of the three main approaches to educational research
include learning and/or teaching as part of their subject matter.
