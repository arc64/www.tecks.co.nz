**Idealism**

Some researchers work on the assumption that there is no external
reality (or at least none that different observers can agree upon) only
the individual realities of individual observers. For example, Lincoln
and Guba, the authors of an influential qualitative methods text, argue
that reality is only what the individual person perceives to be real.
They argue that reality is a construction in the mind of the individual.
Because an infinite number of personal constructions are possible there
are always multiple realities (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). This position is
most commonly referred to as the *idealist position*. (The term
"idealism" is a corruption of the term "idea-ism".) It refers to the
belief that the only things that can be known for certain are our ideas
and the perceptions which produce them. Some writers (e.g. Lincoln &
Guba, 1985) refer to this position as *social constructivism.*

**Realism and critical realism**

Some researchers work on the assumption that there is an external
reality and that it is possible to observe and describe many of the
events which occur in this world. This position is most commonly
referred to as the *realist position*.

Most realists are *critical realists* who recognise that attempts to
observe and describe events such as learning and teaching are strongly
influenced by the concepts and theories of the observer, and that, in
our attempts to observe and describe, we often make mistakes. For
example, Cook and Campbell, the authors of an influential social science
methods text, describe their position as a critical realist position
because they assume that cause and effect relationships exist outside of
the minds of individuals while recognising that these causal
relationships cannot always be perceived with complete accuracy (Cook &
Campbell, 1979). The philosopher of science Karl Popper describes the
critical realist position using the following analogy.

The status of truth in the objective sense, as correspondence to the
facts, and its role as a regulative principle, may be compared to that
of a mountain peak which is permanently, or almost permanently, wrapped
in clouds. The climber may not merely have difficulties in getting
there - he may not know when he gets there, because he may be unable to
distinguish, in the clouds, between the main summit and some subsidiary
peak. Yet this does not affect the objective existence of the summit
(Popper, 1963, p. 226).

Most learning researchers adopt the critical realist assumption because
attempts to observe only make sense if we assume that there is something
out there to be observed.

**Pragmatism**

Some researchers argue that the question of whether or not there is an
external reality which can be observed is a question of no practical
importance. What is important is that when we assume that the world is
real and act on the world as if the world existed, these actions work
for us. This position is most commonly referred to as the *pragmatist
position*. The pragmatist asks: What difference would it practically
make to any one if this notion rather than that notion were true? "What
matters about a bicycle is that I see it, call it by its name, may lend
it to a friend, may ride it myself. Pragmatism remains agnostic about
whether there is a real bicycle behind these effects" (Baum, 1994, p.
20).
