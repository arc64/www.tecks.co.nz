In order to measure the effects of an independent variable (such as a
change in teaching procedure) on some kind of learning, not only must
the investigator develop an accurate measure of behaviour change
(learning), they must also design an experiment which will produce an
accurate measure of the effects of the experimental treatment on
learning. Like attempts to measure learning, attempts to measure the
effects of educational interventions on learning may be more or less
reproducible (reliable), the data from an experiment may be a more or
less accurate representation of the actual treatment effect, and the
conclusion drawn by the experimenter may be a more or less valid
inference from the data generated by the experiment given the
experimental procedures which were used.
