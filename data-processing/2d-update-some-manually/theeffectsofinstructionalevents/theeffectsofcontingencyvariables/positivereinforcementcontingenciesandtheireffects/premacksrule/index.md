Given a choice, all human beings engage in certain behaviours more often
than others. In everyday language we refer to these behaviours as
"preferred activities". The technical term is *high probability
behaviours*. In 1959, the behaviour analyst David Premack demonstrated
that high probability behaviours function as reinforcers for all
behaviours with a lower probability of occurrence (Premack, 1959, 1961,
1963a, 1963b). In other words, if access to a preferred activity is made
contingent upon completion of any less preferred activity, the chances
that the learner will complete the less preferred activity are very
greatly increased. This general principle has come to be known as
\"Premack\'s Rule\".

From a teaching point of view, Premack identified a general principle of
motivation which is now known to be of very wide generality. There are
always some behaviours which even poorly motivated learners engage in
more often than others (even if it is just sitting and doing
\"nothing\"). This means that sources of reinforcement can be identified
for all learners, no matter how poorly motivated.

Because preferred activity reinforcement is so easy to implement, there
are numerous reports of its use in the scientific literature. Preferred
activity reinforcement has been used to motivate reductions in
disruptive behaviour in the classroom (e.g., Marholin, McInnis & Heads,
1974; Moreno & Hovell, 1982), to motivate increases in attention to task
in the classroom (e.g., Edwards, Salant, Howard, Brougher & McLaughlin,
1995), to motivate increased task completion (e.g., Lovitt & Esveldt,
1970), and to motivate increased oral language use (Dolley & Wheldall,
1991; Hart & Risley, 1974). Preferred activity reinforcement has also be
used to shape language (Nordquist & Wahler, 1973), to motivate
improvements in reading (e.g., Cook & White, 1977; Edwards, et al.,
1995), to shape improvements in printing and handwriting (e.g., Hopkins,
Schutte & Garton, 1971; Salzberg, Wheeler, Devar & Hopkins, 1971), to
motivate improvements in spelling (e.g., Lovitt, Guppy & Blattner, 1969)
and compositional writing (Bording, McLaughlin & Williams, 1984;
Newstrom, McLaughlin & Sweeney, 1999) and to motivate improvements in a
variety of different kinds of mathematical skills (e.g., Flaman &
McLaughlin, 1986; Hundert & Batstone, 1978; Lovitt & Esveldt, 1970;
McEvoy & Brady, 1988).

A wide variety of preferred activities have been used to motivate
improvements during practice: self-selected activities during periods of
free time (e.g. Bording et al., 1984), access to educational games
(e.g., Hopkins et al., 1971), access to pre-school play activities
(e.g., Dolley & Wheldall, 1991), access to toys (e.g., Hart & Risley,
1974), access to computers (e.g., Flaman & McLaughlin, 1986), access to
television (e.g., Nordquist & Wahler, 1973), access to listening post
stories (e.g., Cook & White, 1977), and so on.

The motivational effects of contingent access to preferred activities
has been demonstrated across the age range from 3 year olds (Dolley &
Wheldall, 1991) to 16 year olds (e.g. Bording, McLaughlin & Williams,
1984).

The motivational effects of access to preferred activities are just as
strong for children with severe behaviours problems such as conduct
disorder and ADHD (e.g., Edwards et al., 1995; Marholin et al., 1974),
for children with learning disabilities (e.g., Bording et al, 1984) and
for children with intellectual disabilities or autism (e.g., McEvoy &
Brady, 1988; Nordquist & Whaler, 1973) as they are for children without
any kind of disability (e.g. Hopkins et al., 1971; Salzberg et al.,
1971).

Of course, the particular activities which are preferred by individual
children (and which will function as reinforcers for particular
individuals) vary from one learner to the next. Some children will work
hard to earn the opportunity to engage in art activities. Other children
do not find art activities at all reinforcing. This problem is easily
solved in the classroom by asking children to list the things which they
like doing best and by providing contingent access to a menu of high
probability activities so that there is always at least one activity
which will function as a reinforcer for each child in the class.

One characteristic of skilled performance is that it enables the learner
to gain access to other reinforcing activities - activities which
hitherto were inaccessible. The outcome to a child of learning to ride a
bike is the additional, new, reinforcing activities (such as visiting
friends' houses) which become accessible once one has learned how to
ride a bike. It is this kind of outcome which often motivates people to
practise, and eventually to master, new skills.
