The research on response effort has been reviewed by Friman & Poling
(1995). Most of the research on response effort has involved children
and adults with severe intellectual disabilities and non-academic
learning outcomes and it is not yet clear whether the results of this
research will be applicable to performance in the mainstream classroom.

One of the ways of demonstrating the effect of response effort in the
classroom is to compare what happens when students are required to
respond in writing, rather than orally. This comparison has been made
several times (Skinner, Belfiore, Mace, Williams-Wilson & Johns, 1997;
Skinner, Ford & Yunker, 1991). In both of these experiments the
acquisition of maths facts as the learning outcome. When the number of
response opportunities is kept constant in this kind of experiment, oral
responding and written responding produce similar levels of acquisition,
that is, there is no response mode effect. However, when time is held
constant, oral responding results in faster rates of acquisition --
because the children who are responding orally complete larger numbers
of practice responses in the time available (Skinner et al., 1997).

It is to be expected that there will be a reciprocal relationship
between reinforcer strength and response effort. If so, it should be
possible to require considerable response effort from the learner if the
reinforcer for successful task completion is a powerful reinforcer for
the individual concerned. Where the reinforcer is a weak one, it is to
be expected that it will motivate continued effort only if response
effort required for reinforcement is also small. We have located one
test of this assumption so far. The results of an experiment by Gwinn,
Derby, Fisher, Kurtz, Fahs, Augustine and McLaughlin (2005) are
consistent with this view.
