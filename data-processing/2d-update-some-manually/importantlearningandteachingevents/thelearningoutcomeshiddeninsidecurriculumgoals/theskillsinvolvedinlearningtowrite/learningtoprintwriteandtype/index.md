In order to set down their ideas on paper, students must first learn how
to print, or to write cursively, or to type. Handwriting is a fine motor
skill which can only be shaped through extensive practice in copying
models of well formed letters. The effectiveness of this practice is
greatly dependent upon the accuracy of the differential reinforcement
(the differential feedback) provided following practice attempts
(Church, 1999). More than a year's practice is normally required before
the young child begins to produce legible and neatly formed copies of
sentences. Accurate typing, on the other hand, can be acquired much more
rapidly (in a few months) because the level of hand eye coordination
which is required for keyboarding is considerably less than it is for
handwriting. Given the spread of small computers it is clearly important
than all young children have the opportunity to master not only
handwriting but also keyboarding skills.
