In addition to mastering the phoneme--\>grapheme equivalence relations
which are involved in spelling regularly spelled syllables and words,
the novice writer must also acquire a large amount of morphographic
knowledge. For example, "write" and "written" contain a common morpheme
(Templeton & Morris, 2000). Unlike phonemes, morphemes tend to be
spelled in the same way whenever they appear (or to change in
predictable ways). Morphemes are the smallest units of words that are
meaningful. Root words, prefixes and suffixes are examples of morphemes.
English tends to preserve the spelling of morphemes, that is, to use the
same morphograph, even when the pronunciation changes - as in the case
of "magic" and "magician"

A morphographic approach to the teaching of spelling greatly increases
the efficiency of that teaching. This is because there are many fewer
root words than there are words in general. "We know, for example, that
about 800 morphographs appear in 10 or more words and generate
approximately 16,000 words" (Dixon, 1991, p. 287). A second advantage is
that the spelling of morphographs is highly consistent across the words
in which they appear. Either they are spelled in exactly the same way or
else they change their spelling in quite predicable ways - as when
"save" and "make" become "saving" and "making" (Dixon, 1993; Moats,
1995; Templeton & Morris, 2000).
