In order for children to acquire and remember new understandings and to
become competent at new skills, a certain amount of practice is
required. However, a number of factors conspire to limit the amount of
practice engaged in by individual children and this further complicates
the classroom teaching task and affects the long term learning achieved
by both individual students and the class as a whole.
