When responses can be grouped into two mutually exclusive classes such
as appropriate/ inappropriate or correct/incorrect or easy/difficult
three interventions are possible. The teacher can (a) increase the
reinforcement for appropriate responses (e.g. complying), (b) increase
the punishment for inappropriate responses (e.g. not complying) or (c)
do both of these things. The question which arises under these
circumstances is the question regarding the relative effectiveness of
each of these alternatives.

There is no doubt that the differential reinforcement of appropriate
behaviour can result in both an increase the level of appropriate
responding while at the same time producing collateral reductions in
antisocial responses and this has been demonstrated with preschool
children (Conyers, Miltenberger, Romaniuk, Kopp & Himle, 2003; Didden,
de Moor & Bruyns, 1997), with primary school children (Gwinn, Derby,
Fisher, Kurtz, Fahs, Agustine et al., 2005), and with secondary school
students (Workman, Kindall & Williams, 1980).

However, this strategy does not always work. There are a number of
experiments where reinforcing pro-social behaviour on its own has failed
to result in any reduction in the levels of antisocial behaviour engaged
in by the non-compliant child -- especially with older children (e.g.
Rosén, Gabardi, Miller & Miller, 1990).

In these cases, the introduction of a concurrent reinforcement
contingency for appropriate behaviour together with a punishment
contingency for antisocial responses almost always results in a rapid
reduction in antisocial responses and their replacement by appropriate
pro-social responses (Kelley & McCain, 1995; Morris & Redd, 1975; Osnes,
Guevremont & Stokes, 1987; Perry & Fisher, 2001; Pfiffner & O'Leary,
1987; Rosén et al., 1990; Workman, et al., 1980).

Subsequent experimental analyses have identified some of the factors
which operate to determine whether the differential reinforcement of a
prosocial response alone will function to strengthen that response to
the point where antisocial ways of obtaining the same outcome are
abandoned by the learner. The experiments by Perry and Fisher (2001) and
Gwinn et al. (2005) indicate that the effects of differential
reinforcement alone depend upon the degree of response effort required
in making the change from inappropriate (e.g. antisocial) to appropriate
(e.g. pro-social) modes of responding. As the level of response effort
which is involved in making the change increases, differential
reinforcement alone is unlikely to work unless an extremely powerful
reinforcer can be employed. This effect can also be seen in the
experiment by Connors et al. (2003). Strong reinforcers are rarely
available for use in educational settings. If response effort is
considerable, and only reinforcers of moderate strength are available,
then the only way of providing the level of motivation required is to
both reinforce the appropriate social responses and to place an
effective penalty (punishment contingency) on continued use of the
inappropriate or antisocial responses. In the Perry and Fisher
experiment "increasing the price associated with destructive behaviour
by adding a punishment procedure overrode the effects of response effort
and allowed us to rapidly increase the amount of work Anne completed"
(Perry & Fisher, 2001, p. 215).

A second factor which needs to be taken into account is the question of
whether the child is being asked to comply with "do" requests or "don't
requests". A stronger reinforcer is required in motivating compliance
with "don't requests" (Houlihan & Jones, 1990). The reason for this is
unclear but may be because "do requests" explecitly identify the desired
alternative behaviour, that is, the behaviour which will be reinforced.

In situations where response effort is uncontrolled (which is the case
in almost all of these experiments to date), uncontrolled variations in
response effort can be expected to result in variations in experimental
results and this seems to be what is happening in the above cited
experiments.

While the concurrent reinforce-appropriate/punish-inappropriate
contingency usually produces the most rapid change to prosocial
responding, there is some evidence that, once the change has occurred, a
reinforce-appropriate/ignore-inappropriate contingency may be sufficient
to ensure maintenance of the change (Pfiffner & O'Leary, 1987). In fact,
Workman et al. (1980) observed better maintenance of appropriate
responding following concurrent praise-appropriate/ignore-inappropriate
behaviour than following concurrent praise/reprimand contingencies with
poorly behaved junior high school students. This may be because the move
from praise/ignore to normal classroom contingencies was less obvious
than the move from praise/reprimand to normal contingencies.

One of the dilemmas in motivating poorly behaved children to switch from
antisocial to pro-social modes of responding is the fact that while the
concurrent reinforce-prosocial/punish-antisocial contingency is the most
effective across the age range, students usually prefer the
reinforce-prosocial/ignore-antisocial contingency at least during the
early years (Morris & Redd, 1975).
