It seems reasonable to assume that, if the aim is to teach a student how
to perform a new response, behaviour, or action then the type of prompt
required will be some kind of behaviour prompt and not a stimulus
prompt. If, on the other hand, the learner is failing to distinguish
between two things which should be distinguished, or failing to
generalise across the several members of a stimulus class, then the type
of prompt required will be some kind of stimulus prompt (not a behaviour
prompt). In one of the few studies of this assumption, Summers, Rincover
and Feldman (1993) attempted to teach five 3 to 4-year olds with
developmental disabilities to discriminate between \"in\" instructions
and \"on\" instructions using two kinds of prompts: (a) behaviour
prompts (modelling, physical guidance or instructions) and (b) stimulus
prompts (repeating the word "in" or "on"). The stimulus prompts resulted
in acquisition while the behaviour prompts did not.
