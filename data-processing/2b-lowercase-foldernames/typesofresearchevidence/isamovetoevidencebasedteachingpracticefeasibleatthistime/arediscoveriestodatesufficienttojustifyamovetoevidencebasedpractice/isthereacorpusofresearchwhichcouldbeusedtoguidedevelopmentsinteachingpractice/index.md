Educational researchers have been studying learning and teaching for
more than 100 years -- since Ebbinghaus's 1885 studies of memory and
Edgar Rice's 1895 studies of the effects of time spent on spelling
practice. During this time, a number of important learning conditions
have been identified and a number of discoveries have been made with
respect to the kinds of teaching procedures which are, and are not,
likely to result in the learning and remembering of new skills and
understandings. Later sections of this website will explore these
discoveries (and the level of empirical support which exists for them)
in greater detail. In the meantime it is sufficient to observe that
there is much which has been discovered but which has yet to become part
of the working knowledge of classroom teachers.

**Contributions from cognitive and social science research**

The earliest contributions to a knowledge base for learning and teacher
were made by social scientists and cognitive scientists. These
contributions are described in most conventional educational psychology
textbooks (e.g. Gage & Berliner, 1998; Slavin, 1999) and have been
summarised in many meta-analyses and reviews of meta-analyses (e.g.
Lipsey & Wilson, 1993). The best indication of what has been found out
as a result of the application of social science methods (as distinct
from the application of common sense) is provided by the meta-analyses.
These reviews list a number of variables which have been found to have
measurable and reproducible effects on remembering - variables such as
the age of the learner, recency, list length, amount of practice,
meaningfulness of the material to be remembered, the quality of the
explanations provided by the teacher, the provision of learning goals
and study questions, procedures which sustain active engagement by the
learner, conditions which motivate self-rehearsal of the material to be
learned, spaced rehearsal, corrective feedback following errors,
explicit or direct teaching, teaching to mastery, the setting and
evaluation of homework, certain types of co-operative learning
procedures, the teaching of certain types of study skills, the teaching
of grapheme and word recognition skills in reading, and so on (Lipsey &
Wilson, 1993; National Reading Panel, Walberg, 1986; Walberg & Wang,
1987; Wittrock, 1986).

It needs to be remembered, however, that these findings refer to the
effects of certain variables *on the average performance of groups of
learners*. The extent to which these findings apply to individual
learners, the kinds of individuals to whom they apply, and the
conditions under which they operate to determine the learning of
individual students cannot be ascertained from the research literature
because these questions have not been studied by researchers who use the
social science methodology.

**Research into behaviour management**

One of the things which drives more teachers out of the teaching
profession than anything else is a lack of skill in motivating poorly
motivated children and managing the behaviour of disruptive and/or
antisocial children (e.g. Brouwers & Tomic, 2000). This does not need to
continue. During the past 35 years, there has been more scientific
research into motivation and behaviour management than there has been
into any other aspect of classroom practice (e.g. Church, 2003). As a
result of this research we now have an extensive and well documented set
of motivational techniques which are known to be highly effective both
in preventing and in remedying all of the commonly occurring types of
classroom behaviour problems (e.g. Alberto & Troutman, 1999; Church,
1999, 2003; Martella, Nelson & Marchand-Martella, 2002). Senior
researchers (e.g. Greenwood, 2001) continue to express amazement that
this knowledge is not part of the working knowledge of all classroom
teachers and is not even part of the curriculum of many teacher
education programmes.

**Research into matching teaching procedures to desired learning
outcomes**

As a result of scientific research we have discovered that there are
different kinds of learning outcomes which teachers need to distinguish
between. This is because different kinds of teaching and practice
conditions need to be provided before the learning and remembering of
different kinds of skills and understandings can occur (e.g. Church,
1999; Engelmann & Carnine 1991). For example, behaviour analysts are
studying the conditions necessary for language development (e.g. Hart &
Risley, 1995; Sidman, 1994); the conditions necessary for the
development of meaning (DeGrandpre, 2000; Sidman, 1994; Skinner, 1957;
Staats, 1968); the conditions necessary for the development of various
kinds of motor skills (e.g. Koop, & Martin, 1983; Ward, Crouch, &
Patrick, 1998), the conditions necessary for the development of
mathematical competencies (e.g. Blankenship & Baumgartner, 1982; Paine,
Carnine, White, & Walters, 1982) and the conditions necessary for the
development of literacy skills including reading (e.g. Carnine &
Silbert, 1979; Gersten, Keating, & Becker, 1988), reading comprehension
(e.g. Bigler, 1984; Bruce & Chan, 1991), handwriting (e.g. Stowitschek,
Ghezzi, & Safely, 1987), spelling (e.g. Dixon, 1993; Okyere, Heron, &
Goddard, 1997), and compositional writing (e.g. Hopman & Glynn, 1988).
Behaviour analysts are also studying the development of self-control
(e.g. Brown, & Frank, 1990; Watson & Tharp, 2002) and creativity (e.g.
Winston & Baker, 1985).

An understanding of the conditions which are necessary in order for
children to acquire different kinds of learning outcomes is essential
knowledge for anyone who is involved in instructional design at any
level.

**Research into adapting instruction to prevent learning failures**

As a result of scientific research we have discovered how to track, from
lesson to lesson, the improvements in new skills and/or understandings
which are occurring during the course of instruction (e.g. Church, 1996;
Deno & Fuchs, 1987; Shapiro, 1996) and we have discovered that the
children of teachers who have mastered these skills learn more (because
their teachers make better adaptive teaching decisions) than the
children of teachers who have not mastered these skills (e.g. Stecker &
Fuchs, 2000).

**Research into maintaining motivation in all children**

We have identified many of the variables which affect motivation. We
have discovered that it is the consequences of student effort (not the
interest level of the activity) which is the most important variable. We
have developed a number of procedures which work to motivate even the
most poorly motivated learners (e.g. Alberto & Troutman, 2002; Martella,
Nelson & Marchand-Martella, 2002; Sulzer-Azaroff & Mayer, 1991) and we
long ago discovered that the children of teachers who have mastered
these procedures learn more (because they get more done) than the
children of teachers who have not mastered these procedures (e.g.
Broughton & Lahey, 1978; Lovitt, Guppy & Blattner, 1969).

**Research into the appropriate level of structure during instruction**

We have discovered that loosely structured teaching arrangements (such
as discovery learning and constructivist learning arrangements) result
in lower levels of understanding and slower rates of mastery for the
great majority of children than do more carefully structured teaching
arrangements (Adams & Engelmann, 1996; Chall, 2002; Church, 1976;
Hermann, 1969; Mayer, 2004). The results of controlled experimental
research stand in stark contrast to the beliefs of classroom teachers
and teacher educators regarding the efficacy of discovery learning.

We have discovered that co-operative learning activities can facilitate
learning but only if each child's learning is monitored and there is
some kind of incentive for group members to tutor each other in an
effective manner (Slavin, 1990). This is a major departure from the way
in which these procedures are currently used by classroom teachers.

**Research into the number of learning opportunities and their
scheduling in time**

We have discovered not only that learning activities must be within the
child's zone of proximal development, but also that it is the number of
times that a child comes into contact with a particular word, fact,
concept or idea which is the most important determinant of whether or
not it will be remembered (e.g. Church, 1976; Greenwood, Delquadri &
Hall, 1984; Greenwood, Hart, Walker & Risley, 1994; Hart & Risley, 1995;
Heward, 1994; McWilliams, 2006; Nuthall, 1999).

Not only have we discovered that the number of learning opportunities is
critical but also that their distribution in time is critical as well.
During knowledge learning tasks, a new item of knowledge is only
remembered if the child gets to work with that idea on at least four
occasions with no more than two days between each learning opportunity
(Nuthall, 1999). This is essential knowledge for anyone who is
responsible for ensuring that children learn and remember particular
skills and understandings.

**Research into the conditions necessary for the development of new
understandings and the avoidance of misunderstandings**

We have identified the critical teaching conditions which must be
provided in order for children to master new understandings and have
developed procedures for explaining and teaching new concepts and rules
which are much more effective than the classroom procedures currently in
use (e.g. Church, 1999; Engelmann & Carnine, 1991; Muthukrishna,
Carnine, Grossen, & Miller, 1993). Of particular importance is the
research into the relative efficiency of different kinds of explanations
and example sequencing operations. This knowledge is essential knowledge
for anyone who is involved in subject matter teaching or instructional
design.

**Research into prompting procedures during the teaching of new skills
and operations**

We have identified many of the critical teaching conditions which must
be provided in teaching new skills and have developed prompting and
scaffolding procedures (for teaching new skills, procedures, and
metacognitive skills) which are much more effective than the procedures
currently used by classroom teachers (e.g. Pressley, Harris & Guthrie,
1992; Wolery, Bailey & Sugai, 1988).

**Research into the conditions necessary for remembering**

We have discovered that recall speed (i.e. level of fluency) is the best
predictor of long term retention. We have developed procedures for
measuring recall speed which are both accurate and simple enough for
everyday classroom use and we are making good progress in identifying
the kinds of practice procedures which are most effective in helping
students achieve a level of fluency sufficient to ensure that essential
skills and understandings are not forgotten (e.g. Binder, Haughton &
Bateman, 2002; Church, 1999; Johnson & Layng, 1994; White and Haring,
1980; Wolery, Bailey & Sugai, 1988). The results of the research into
fluency and fluency building, although essential for planning effective
teaching-practice cycles is almost completely unknown to classroom
teachers.
