In an earlier section we observed that planning, providing and
monitoring developmentally appropriate practice activities for 25-30
learners concurrently from hour to hour and day to day is an extremely
complex and difficult task. Teachers attempt to solve this problem in a
variety of ways, by organising homework, peer tutoring, computer
assisted instruction, Direct Instruction groups, and so on. However,
each of these solutions creates further problems. Homework has to be
marked. Peer tutoring cuts the time available for practice in half.
Adequately programmed computer assisted instruction is extremely
expensive. Direct Instruction programmes limit teachers' freedom to
innovate. How teachers attempt to solve these problems introduces
further variability into the complex task of measuring the effects of
teaching on learning in the classroom context.
