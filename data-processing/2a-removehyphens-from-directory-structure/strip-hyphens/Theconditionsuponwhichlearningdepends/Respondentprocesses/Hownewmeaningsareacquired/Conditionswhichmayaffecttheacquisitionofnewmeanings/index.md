It is to be expected that there will be a number of conditions which
will affect how speedily learners can acquire the meanings of initially
meaningless words, symbols, signs and so on. For example, it is has been
demonstrated that first order conditioning occurs more rapidly than
second-order conditioning and that the number of trials affects the
level of meaningfulness which is acquired (Staats & Staats, 1959).
However, apart from this, little is known.

Why is so little known about the acquisition of meaning? Little is known
about how children acquire new meanings because this topic has been of
little interest to learning researchers. A literature search for
analyses of the way in which children acquire meaning identifies
hundreds of articles containing theoretical accounts of how children
"construct meaning" and only a dozen or so experimental analyses of
children actually "constructing meaning".

In fact the phrase "constructing meaning" is probably a misleading
description of what actually happens. The phrase "constructing meaning"
suggests some kind of elaborate, conscious, thinking process on the part
of the learner whereas the experimental analysis of children who are in
the process of acquiring new meanings suggests that meaning responses
tend to be acquired extremely quickly and, in many cases, to be acquired
without conscious awareness (e.g. Staats, Staats & Crawford, 1962).
