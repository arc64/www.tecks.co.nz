Behaviour analysts have shown a strong preference for experimental
analysis and 95% of published behaviour analysis reports are reports of
experiments (Church, 1998). Most behaviour analysis experiments are
within-subject experiments rather than between-groups experiments. The
experimental procedures of the behaviour analyst are variously referred
to as single-case experiments (Barlow & Hersen, 1984; Martella, Nelson &
Marchand-Martella, 1999), within-subject experiments (Church, 1996;
Poling, Methot & LeSage, 1995), or behaviour analysis experiments
(Cooper, Heron & Heward, 1987).

During a within-subject experiment, the effects of a particular
environmental intervention (such as a change in teaching procedure) are
measured by observing and recording the behaviour changes of individual
learners, first, on a number of occasions prior to the intervention and,
then, on a number of occasions following the intervention. "Discovering
or establishing baselines in the behavior of individual subjects, either
by recording data across time as it occurs prior to any intervention, or
by manipulating contingencies so that behavior develops a steady state,
behavior analysts begin with a measure of behavior for each of the
subjects involved. The effect of an independent variable is assessed
against each subject\'s individual baseline" (Chiesa, 1994, p. 84). In
the case of experimental analyses of learning, the purpose of the
baseline condition is often to establish *rate of acquisition* prior to
introduction of the experimental teaching procedure (Church, 2004).

Most of the experimental designs used by behaviour analysts are
replication designs. These replication designs take a variety of forms:
alternating conditions designs, reversal designs, multiple baseline
designs, changing criterion designs, and so on, but all have one
characteristic in common and that is that the experimenter attempts to
obtain more than a single measure of the effect of a particular
experimental treatment on the learning outcome which is of interest. A
detailed discussion of the replication designs most commonly used in
behaviour analysis research will be found in Cooper, Heron and Heward
(1987).

Although behaviour analysis textbooks usually describe the most commonly
used kinds of experimental designs, they also counsel a flexible
approach to experimental design. "The fact is that *there are no rules
of experimental design*. Every experiment is unique" (Sidman, 1960). Use
of a within-subject time-series, experimental method allows the
behaviour analyst to make modifications to his or her experiment as the
experiment proceeds and, hence, to change focus during the course of an
experiment and to explore new questions in addition to the question
which initially motivated the research. For example, an experiment which
resulted in much variability in performance during the baseline or
pre-intervention phase might be modified to introduce additional
experimental controls and further (modified) baseline observations
undertaken before the experimental manipulation was introduced
(Blampied, 1999). An experimental evaluation of an intervention which
did not work might be extended to include subsequent phases documenting
the effectiveness of successive attempts to improve the effectiveness of
that intervention (e.g. Sandford, 1991).
