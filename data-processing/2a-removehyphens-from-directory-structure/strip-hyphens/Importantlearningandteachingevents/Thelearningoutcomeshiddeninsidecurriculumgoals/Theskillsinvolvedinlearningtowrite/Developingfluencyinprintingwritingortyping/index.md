The aim of handwriting instruction is to bring the student to the point
where they can write both legibly and with a functional level of speed.
Children "need to develop enough fluency so that the mechanics of
producing text do not interfere with the process of composing" (Graham &
Weintraub, 1996, p. 7). Fluent handwriting is handwriting which is (a)
legible, (b) fast, and (c) writing which occurs with little conscious
attention to the physical act of forming the letters.

The same is true of typing. Typing skills become functional only when
they have been practised to the point where copy typing can be performed
with accuracy and speed, that is, with a functional level of fluency.

The development of fluent writing and typing requires considerable
practice. This practice must be timed practice so that the learner (and
the teacher) can see whether or not improvements in speed are occurring.
In spite of its obvious importance, educational researchers have yet to
identify the handwriting fluency levels and the typing fluency levels
which are characteristic of children at each age level who are making
average rates of progress in learning to write.
