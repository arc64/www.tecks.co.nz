Practice activities can require the learner to respond in a variety of
different modes. Some of the most common response modes observed in the
classroom are

-   *saying* (as in giving an oral answer, reading out loud, reciting,
    giving a talk, and so on),
-   *writing* (as in writing the answers to questions, compositional
    writing, copying notes from the blackboard, completing written
    exercises, and so on) and
-   *doing* (as in cutting and pasting, practising a gymnastic exercise,
    playing a musical instrument, imitating the movements of another
    child, and so on).
