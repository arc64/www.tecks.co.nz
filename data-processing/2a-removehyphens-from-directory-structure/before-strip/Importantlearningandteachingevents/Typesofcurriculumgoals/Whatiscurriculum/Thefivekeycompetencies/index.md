The New Zealand curriculum identifies five competencies which are to be
considered the key to learning in each of the eight learning areas.
Students are to be continually challenged to develop these key
competencies over time in contexts which are increasingly wide ranging
and complex. The five key competencies are:

1.Thinking (the ability to seek, use and create knowledge, ask
questions, and challenge the basis of assumptions and perceptions).

2.Using language, symbols and text (the ability to interpret and use
words, number, images, movement, metaphor and technologies in a range of
contexts).

3.Managing oneself (the ability to self-motivate, establish goals, make
plans, and set standards for oneself).

4.Relating to others (the ability to interact effectively with a diverse
range of people in a variety of contexts).

5.Participating and contributing (the ability to respond appropriately
as a member of a group, to make connections with others, and to create
opportunities for including others in group activities).
