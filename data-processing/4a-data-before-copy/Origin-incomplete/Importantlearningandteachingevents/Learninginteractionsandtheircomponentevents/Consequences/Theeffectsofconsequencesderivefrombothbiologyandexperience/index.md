Human beings are born with a built-in capacity to be reinforced by
certain events. Other events acquire the power to function as
reinforcers as a result of experience. The same is true of punishers.
While one can be an effective teacher without knowing how this occurs,
an understanding of how experience turns some events into reinforcers
and punishers is necessary if we are to understand why it is that the
same consequence can have different effects on the behaviour of
different individuals.

The biological reinforcers and punishers are referred to as
unconditioned (unlearned) reinforcers and punishers in some texts, and
as primary reinforcers and primary punishers in some texts.
