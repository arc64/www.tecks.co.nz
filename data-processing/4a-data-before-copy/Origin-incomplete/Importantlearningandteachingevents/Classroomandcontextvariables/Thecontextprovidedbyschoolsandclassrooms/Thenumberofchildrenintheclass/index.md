A contextual variable which has a strong effect on classroom learning is
class size, that is, the number of students in the class. This is
because instruction which is designed to meet the learning needs of
individual students tends to be much more effective than whole-class
instruction and class size strongly constrains the amount of
individualisation which is possible.

*Class size.* Class size can be quantified either by counting the number
of children who are enrolled in the class or by counting the number of
children who attend from day to day. The former measure is the most
common but the latter measure is more appropriate.
