The term *diagnostic assessment resource* refers to standardised tests
for assessing the level of development of individual children with
respect to key academic skills such as phonemic awareness, decoding
fluency, reading fluency, vocabulary level, reading level, handwriting
fluency, spelling level, morphological knowledge, compositional writing
fluency, mathematical concept knowledge, fluency with respect to single
digit number facts, fluency with respect to expected mathematical
operations, and so on. Only if the classroom teacher has access to
diagnostic tests of known reliability can developmentally appropriate
teaching goals be identified for each student for each of the main
academic skills.

As far as classroom practice is concerned, the diagnostic resources
which have the greatest impact on teaching effectiveness are those which
are immediately available, that is, available from the school's resource
room. The adequacy of the diagnostic materials available to the teacher
may be measured by examining the school store room and counting the
number of academic skills at each year level for which diagnostic
instruments of known reliability are immediately available for classroom
use.
