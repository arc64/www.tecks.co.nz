In most countries, the school curriculum consists of a set of documents
which set out what children are expected to learn and remember as a
result of their attendance at school. Most curricula contain a mixture
of general aims and principles, general statements describing areas of
study, lists of skills and understandings which children are expected to
acquire at school, and lists of desirable human qualities, attitudes,
and dispositions which schools are required to develop. The New Zealand
curriculum consists largely of \"achievement objectives\" at each of
eight "levels". These achievement objectives describe in very general
terms the kinds of skills which teachers might observe once a child has
reached a particular level. For example, a child achieving at Level 1 in
Mathematics would be expected to "know the forward and backward counting
sequences with whole numbers to 100" and, at Level 2 Mathematics, to
"know the forward and backward counting sequences with whole numbers to
at least 1000."
