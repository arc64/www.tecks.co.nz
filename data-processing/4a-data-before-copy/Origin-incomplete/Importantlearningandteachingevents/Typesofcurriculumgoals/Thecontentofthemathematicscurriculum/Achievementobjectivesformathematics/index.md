Summaries of the achievement objectives for the first three levels of
study in number and algebra, geometry and measurement, and statistics
are as follows.

**Level 1**

*In Number and Algebra students will solve problems and model situations
that require them to:*

-   Use a range of counting, grouping, and equal-sharing strategies with
    whole numbers and fractions.
-   Know the forward and backward counting sequences of whole numbers to
    100.
-   Know groupings with five, within ten and with ten.
-   Communicate and explain counting, grouping, and equal-sharing
    strategies, using words, numbers, and pictures.
-   Generalise that the next counting number gives the result of adding
    one object to a set and that counting the number of objects in a set
    tells how many.
-   Create and continue sequential patterns.

*In Geometry and Measurement students will solve problems and model
situations that require them to:*

-   Order and compare objects or events by length, area, volume and
    capacity, weight (mass), turn (angle), temperature, and time by
    direct comparison and/or counting whole numbers of units.
-   Sort objects by their appearance.
-   Give and follow instructions for movement that involves distances,
    directions, and half or quarter turns.
-   Describe their position relative to a person or object.
-   Communicate and record the results of translations, reflections, and
    rotations on plane shapes.

*In Statistics students will solve problems and model situations that
require them to:*

-   Conduct investigations using the statistical enquiry cycle:
-   posing and answering questions;
-   gathering, sorting and counting, and displaying category data;
-   discussing the results.
-   Interpret statements made by others from statistical investigations
    and probability activities.
-   Investigate situations that involve elements of chance,
    acknowledging and anticipating possible outcomes.

**Level 2**

*In Number and Algebra students will solve problems and model situations
that require them to:*

-   Use simple additive strategies with whole numbers and fractions.
-   Know forward and backward counting sequences with whole numbers to
    at least 1000.
-   Know the basic addition and subtraction facts.
-   Know how many ones, tens, and hundreds are in whole numbers to at
    least 1000.
-   Know simple fractions in everyday use.
-   Communicate and interpret simple additive strategies, using words,
    diagrams (pictures), and symbols.
-   Generalise that whole numbers can be partitioned in many ways.
-   Find rules for the next member in a sequential pattern.

*In Geometry and Measurement students will solve problems and model
situations that require them to:*

-   Create and use appropriate units and devices to measure length,
    area, volume and capacity, weight (mass), turn (angle), temperature,
    and time.
-   Partition and/or combine like measures and communicate them, using
    numbers and units.
-   Sort objects by their spatial features, with justification.
-   Identify and describe the plane shapes found in objects.
-   Create and use simple maps to show position and direction.
-   Describe different views and pathways from locations on a map.
-   Predict and communicate the results of translations, reflections,
    and rotations on plane shapes.

*In Statistics students will solve problems and model situations that
require them to:*

-   Conduct investigations, using the statistical enquiry cycle:
-   posing and answering questions;
-   gathering, sorting, and displaying category and whole number data;
-   communicating findings based on the data.
-   Compare statements with the features of simple data displays from
    statistical investigations or probability activities undertaken by
    others.
-   Investigate simple situations that involve elements of chance,
    recognizing equal and different likelihoods and acknowledging
    uncertainty.

**Level 3**

*In* *Number and Algebra students will solve problems and model
situations that require them to:*

-   Use a range of additive and simple multiplicative strategies with
    whole numbers, fractions, decimals, and percentages.
-   Know basic multiplication and division facts.
-   Know counting sequences for whole numbers.
-   Know how many tenths, tens, hundreds, and thousands are in whole
    numbers.
-   Know fractions and percentages in everyday use.
-   Record and interpret additive and simple multiplicative strategies,
    using words, diagrams, and symbols, with an understanding of
    equality.
-   Generalise the properties of addition and subtraction with whole
    numbers.
-   Connect members of sequential patterns with their ordinal position
    and use tables, graphs, and diagrams to find relationships between
    successive elements of number and spatial patterns.

*In Geometry and Measurement students will solve problems and model
situations that require them to:*

-   Use linear scales and whole numbers of metric units for length,
    area, volume and capacity, weight (mass), angle, temperature, and
    time.
-   Find areas of rectangles and volumes of cuboids by applying
    multiplication.
-   Classify plane shapes and prisms by their spatial features.
-   Represent objects with drawings and models.
-   Use a co-ordinate system or the language of direction and distance
    to specify locations and describe paths.
-   Describe the transformations (reflection, rotation, translation, or
    enlargement) that have mapped one object on to another.

*In Statistics students will solve problems and model situations that
require them to:*

-   Conduct investigations using the statistical enquiry cycle:
-   gathering, sorting, and displaying multivariate category and whole
    number data and simple time-series data to answer questions;
-   identifying patterns and trends in context, within and between data
    sets;
-   communicating findings, using data displays.
-   Evaluate the effectiveness of different displays in representing the
    findings of a statistical investigation or probability activity
    undertaken by others.
-   Investigate simple situations that involve elements of chance by
    comparing experimental results with expectations from models of all
    the outcomes, acknowledging that samples vary.
