Someone who is trying to learn a new idea, or concept, or word or skill
may experience any number of practice opportunities involving that new
idea or skill from none to thousands. Only if practice responses occur
can learning occur. If only one or two practice responses occur it is
extremely unlikely that the new idea or skill will be learned and
remembered. This makes practice responses a necessary condition for
learning and it makes the number of practice opportunities experienced
by the learner the major determinant of learning. Because the number of
practice responses is a major determinant of learning it follows that
this variable is the most important of the variables which needs to be
managed by teachers and the most important of the variables which must
be controlled and recorded during research into learning and teaching.
