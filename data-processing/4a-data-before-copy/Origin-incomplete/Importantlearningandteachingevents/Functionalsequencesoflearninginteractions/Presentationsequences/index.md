When teachers provide an explanation, take a lesson, give a lecture, and
so on, you will almost always observe sequences of presentations, that
is sequences of statements about the subject matter or topic which the
teacher is talking about. Presentation sequences also occur during
multi-media presentations such as instructional videos and films,
illustrated lectures, and so on. Some of the ways in which presentations
can vary have been listed already. Just as individual presentations can
vary with respect to presentation mode, content, and meaningfulness so
can sequences of presentations. In addition, sequences of presentations
can vary with respect to their length, the number of and range of
examples referred to, the way in which examples and non-examples are
sequenced, and so on.
