**Effects of reinforcing on task behaviour**

Attention to the task at hand is an essential prerequisite for learning
from classroom tasks. When children are engaged in classroom tasks under
condition in which attention to task is reinforced, the level of
attention to task almost always increases. This effect has been
demonstrated for preschool children (Hamblin & Hamblin, 1972). It has
been demonstrated for primary school children with disabilities (Dixon,
Fitzharris & Moore, 1989; Henderson, Jenson & Erken, 1986; Kazdin &
Mascitelli, 1980) and for primary school children without disabilities
(Glynn, 1972; Glynn, Thomas & Shee, 1973; Kazdin, 1973; Rooney, Hallahan
& Lloyd, 1984; Simmons & Wasik, 1976; Surrat, Ulrich & Hawkins, 1969;
Winett, Richards, Krasner & Krasner, 1971; Yawkey, 1971). It has been
demonstrated for secondary school students (Fontenelle & Holliman, 1983;
Workman, Kindall & Williams, 1980). And it is been demonstrated for
children with conduct problems (Sutherland, Wehby & Copeland, 2000;
Thomas, Pohl, Presland & Glynn, 1977).

**Effects of reinforcing productivity**

A second way of motivating attention to classroom tasks and completion
of classroom tasks is to reinforce students for completing the work set,
or to reinforce students for the number of practice exercises completed.
This dimension of academic performance, task completion is most commonly
referred to as productivity. The effect of reinforcing children's
productivity in the classroom is to motivate increased productivity.
This effect has also been demonstrated for children of varying ages and
for children both with and without disabilities (e.g., Drew, Evans,
Bostow & Drash, 1982; Leach & Byrne, 1986; Lovitt & Esveldt, 1970;
McLaughlin, 1984; McLaughlin & Malaby, 1976; Trice, Parker, Furrow &
Iwata, 1983).

**Effects of reinforcing accurate performance**

In many cases practice responses can be classified as correct or
incorrect and, in these cases, it is possible to make classroom feedback
and reinforcement contingent upon responding correctly or contingent
upon the number or proportion of responses which are correct. This
operation (reinforcing accurate responding) almost always results in an
increase in the level of accuracy during practice. This effect has been
demonstrated in more than 130 separate experiments involving children
with and without disabilities at all age levels. The effect has been
observed with children working on pronunciation tasks (e.g. Johnson &
Johnson, 1972), handwriting tasks (e.g., McLaughlin, 1981), maths tasks
(e.g., Hundert & Batstone, 1978), word recognition tasks (e.g., Lahey &
Drabman, 1974), prose reading tasks (e.g., Fry, 1973; Lahey, McNees &
Schnelle, 1977), reading comprehension tasks (e.g., Edwards, Salant,
Howard, Brougher & McLaughlin, 1995; Lib, Sachs & Boyd, 1973), spelling
tasks (e.g., Kapadia & Fantuzzo, 1988), compositional writing tasks
(e.g., Bording, McLaughlin & Williams, 1984; Newstrom, McLaughlin &
Sweeney, 1999), social studies tasks (e.g., Lo & Cartledge, 2004) and
social skills practice (e.g., Falk, Dunlap & Kern, 1996).

Of course, reinforcing accuracy on learning tasks can only result in
increases in the number correct if (a) correct responding is less than
100% and (b) if the student actually knows how to obtain the correct
answer (Duhon, Noell, Witt, Freeland, Dufrene & Gilbertson, 2004).

**Effects of reinforcing low response rates**

Reinforcement can also be made contingent upon responding at a
particular rate. A common procedure for teaching self regulation, for
example, is to reinforce the student for reducing disruptive responses
or antisocial responses to low level. This procedure is referred to as
the differential reinforcement of a low rate of responding (or DRL for
short). The introduction of a DRL contingency almost always motivates a
level of self-regulation sufficient to ensure that the reinforcement is
earned. This effect has been observed with children with behaviour
problems (both mild and severe) at the preschool level (Deitz, Slack,
Schwarzmueller, Wilander, Weatherly & Hilliard, 1978), the primary
school level (Blue, Madsen & Heimburg, 1981; Deitz & Repp, 1973, 1974;
Ellery, Blampied & Black, 1975; Grieger, 1970), the intermediate school
level (Hobs, Halt & Richardson, 1977) and the secondary level (Deitz &
Repp, 1973; Theodore, Bray, Kehle & Jenson, 2001; Zwald & Gresham,
1982).

DRL has several advantages in that it functions to teach self-regulation
without punishing the child for misbehaving and because high levels of
self-regulation can be achieved by successively reducing the criterion
(the number of mistakes allowed) until the child is misbehaving no more
frequently than his or her normally developing peers (Epstein, Repp &
Cullinan, 1978).

**Effects of reinforcing high response rates**

It is also possible to reinforce children for responding with increasing
speed or for completing a task or set of tasks at a criterion speed or
within a criterion time-limit. The effect of reinforcing children for
responding promptly or quickly (without reference to accuracy) has been
little studied -- probably because teachers are more often interested
building faster correct responding than faster responding per se.
However, it is clear that when responding quickly is reinforced, faster
responding usually results (Ferguson, Ashbaugh, O'Reilly & McLaughlin,
2004; Lovitt and Esveldt, 1970).

**Effects of reinforcing fluent performance**

One of the dimensions of classroom performance which is often of
interest to the teacher is fluency, that is, the number of correct
responses per minute or the number of responses completed correctly
within a given time limit. Fluency is of interest because fluent
performances are retained for long periods of time even in the absence
of practice. A number of controlled experiments have examined the
effects of reinforcing correct responses under conditions where
reinforcement is either proportional to the number of correct responses
per minute or else conditional on increases in fluency. Provided the
child has acquired the ability to respond correctly (Daly, Murdoch,
Lillenstein, Webber & Lentz, 2002), reinforcing responding which is both
correct and speedy almost always results in more rapid improvements in
fluency (accuracy rate) than is the case with repetitive practice, that
is, practice without reinforcement for improvements in fluency (Brown,
Copeland & Hall, 1986; Faykus & McCurdy, 1998; McDowell & Keenan, 2001;
McEvoy & Brady, 1988; Pigott, Fantuzzo, Heggie & Clement, 1984; Schloss,
Sedlak, Elliot & Smothers, 1982; Smith & Lovitt, 1974, 1976; Wolfe,
Fantuzzo & Wolter, 1984).

**Effects of reinforcing response diversity**

Sometimes the goal of instruction is to foster response diversity. This
is most commonly referred to as fostering "creativity". The effects of
reinforcing children for the diversity of their responses has been
examined experimentally in the free play setting (Holman, Goetz & Baer,
1977), during drawing activities (Fallon & Goetz, 1975), and during
compositional writing activities (Glover & Sautter, 1977; Ryan &
Winston, 1978). In all cases, reinforcing children for the diversity of
their responses has resulted in increased form diversity, that is,
increased creativity. These results challenge the widely held belief
that creativity is an inherited disposition or that it can be fostered
simply by providing opportunities to "be creative" (Fallon & Goetz,
1975).
