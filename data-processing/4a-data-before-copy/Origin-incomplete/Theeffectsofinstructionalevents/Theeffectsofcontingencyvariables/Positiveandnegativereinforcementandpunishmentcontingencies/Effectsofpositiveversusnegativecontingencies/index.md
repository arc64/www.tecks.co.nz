It is possible to motivate improvements in performance using either
positive reinforcement contingencies or negative reinforcement
contingencies. Both have a similar effect both on motivation and on
improvements in performance (McGoey & DuPaul, 2000; Morris & Redd, 1975;
Pfiffner & O'Leary, 1987; Trice & Parker, 1983). However, they have
markedly different effects on the development of likes and dislikes.

This is because the only consequence of failing to perform a positively
reinforced behaviour is that the learner does not receive the
reinforcement. This is a fairly neutral consequence. The consequence of
failing to perform a negatively reinforced behaviour, however, is that
the learner fails to avoid the aversive consequence. That is, the
learner is punished. Errors, mistakes, and other kinds of failure often
result in an aversive consequence. Most learners experience even
corrective feedback as aversive. Working to avoid an aversive outcome
(working under the constant threat of punishment) leaves people feeling
anxious and motivates them to look for ways of avoiding either the task
or the situation altogether. Working to earn reinforcement, on the other
hand, leaves people feeling confident and positive about the tasks which
they are being asked to perform and situation in which they are working.

Many people fail to recognise that, when a punishment procedure is
introduced, it may function either as a positive punishment contingency
(suppressing the behaviour which produces the punishment) or as a
negative reinforcement contingency (strengthening any behaviour which
avoids the punishment). Hence attempts to suppress a behaviour (such as
lying) by punishing it introduce the possibility that alternative
behaviours which succeed in avoiding the punishment (such as lying more
convincingly) will be strengthened through negative reinforcement.

Both punishment and negative reinforcement involve the use of aversive
events (or the threat of such events). Both kinds of contingencies
usually make the learner feel anxious and both kinds of contingencies
can result in the development of a dislike for the situation where the
threat of punishment is present (Morris & Redd, 1975). However, the
motivating effects of the two contingencies could not be more different.
Punishment contingencies *suppress* the punished behaviour (e.g.,
Lovittt, Lovitt, Eaton & Kirkwood, 1973; Luce, Delquadri & Hall, 1980)
while negative reinforcement contingencies *strengthen* the avoidance
behaviour (e.g., Leach & Tan, 1996; Pfiffner & O'Leary, 1987).
