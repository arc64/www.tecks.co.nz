It seems reasonable to assume that practice responses should closely
simulate the responses which will be required after training has been
completed. If this is the case, then selection responses will be more
efficient when the child is learning new discriminations and
generalisations as in, for example, learning to tell the difference
between adverbs and adjectives, or the difference between addition word
problems and multiplication word problems. In contrast, constructed
responses will be more efficient when the child is learning how to
perform a new response, procedure or skill as in, for example, learning
to spell or to write or to calculate. However, there appears to have
been no controlled research into this assumption.
