The acquisition phase is the initial period of improvement. It covers
that period of time from when the learner is unable to respond correctly
without assistance through to when they are able to respond correctly
without assistance. The acquisition phase involves a change from being
unable to perform the new skill through to being able to perform it --
but only with assistance. The skill can be performed, but not
independently, not without some assistance.

The end of the acquisition phase is marked by the emergence of
independent, or unassisted correct responding. The learner is able to
perform the new skill independently, that is, without assistance or
reminders. When a learner can respond correctly without assistance we
say that he or she has reached the *independence level* with respect to
the skill, competency, or understanding which is of interest. Note that
independent performance may still not be very skilled. It may be slow
and hesitant and still require much concentration.

When people talk about learning it is often the acquisition phase which
they are referring to and when people test for learning using some kind
of measure of correct responding, it is usually acquisition, that is,
the achievement of independent performance which they are testing for.
