The consequences of successful and unsuccessful responses, behaviours,
and actions may follow the action immediately or they may following the
action after a period of time. For example, when a student attempts a
basketball shot the consequences are immediate because the student can
immediately see whether the shot went through the hoop or not. On the
other hand, the success or otherwise of a student's attempts to prepare
for a test will not be known by the student until the test has been
completed, marked by the teacher, and the marks returned to the student.

In this account we will refer to the delay between the completion of a
response and the occurrence of any consequence such as feedback as the
*post-response interval*. The post-response interval is the time which
elapses between completion of the learner\'s response to the practice
stimulus and the presentation of any consequence by the teacher, the
instructional medium or the environment. The post response interval can
vary from a fraction of a second (as in the goal shooting example) to
several weeks (as in the test preparation example).

The post-response interval is referred to by some writers as "wait-time"
or as "wait-time II" or as "teacher wait time". This usage is normally
limited to the period of time which the teacher waits following a
student answer before reacting to that answer and hence refers to a
particular kind of post-response interval.

The post-response interval is an important instructional variable
because it affects rate of acquisition. In addition, the most
efficacious post-response interval is different for correct responses
and for incorrect responses.
