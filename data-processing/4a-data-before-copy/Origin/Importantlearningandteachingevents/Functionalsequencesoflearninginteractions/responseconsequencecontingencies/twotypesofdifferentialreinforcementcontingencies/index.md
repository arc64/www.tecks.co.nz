Successful responses may generate many different kinds of reinforcing
consequences. They may be naturally reinforced by getting the outcome
which the learner wants, they may be reinforced with positive feedback,
or by a positive reaction from another person or by gaining access to a
preferred activity, and so on.

Unsuccessful responses may generate consequences in the form of negative
feedback, a negative response from others, postponement of access to a
more reinforcing activity, and/or a prompt and a request to try again,
and so on.

Because there are dozens of different ways of reinforcing correct
responses, and many different ways of reacting to errors, the
differential reinforcement of improvements in performance can be
accomplished in hundreds of different ways. However, these differential
reinforcement arrangements can be grouped under two general headings as
shown in the table below.

Notice that in both of these types of differential reinforcement,
correct (or improved) responses are followed by reinforcement. The
reinforcing consequences may be any of the types of reinforcing
consequences previously described.

Where the two types of differential reinforcement differ is with respect
to what happens following incorrect (or unsatisfactory) responses. There
are two main possibilities.

1.The first is that the errors are simply ignored, that is, neither
accepted as correct, nor corrected. This procedure is very frequently
used by teachers. If one student responds with an incomplete or less
than satisfactory answer, the teacher simply calls upon another student
to respond to the original question.

2.The second possibility is that errors result in some kind consequence.
The most commonly observed consequences are: (a) somebody provides some
kind of error feedback (e.g. "No, that's not right."), (b) somebody
provides error feedback and some kind of correction (e.g. tells the
learner the correct response), or (c) somebody provides error feedback,
and a prompt, and a secondary response opportunity.

It is important to distinguish between these two types of differential
reinforcement because many teachers prefer to use the first type (in
which errors are ignored) whereas others teachers believe that errors
should be corrected. (The research suggests that we learn more rapidly
when our errors are corrected.)
