As can be seen from the list of achievement objectives at each level,
these are specified in quite general terms, and the content at each
level is left unspecified. In fact the curriculum does not even provide
examples of suitable teaching topics under each objective.

Like the literacy and mathematics curricula, the Science curriculum does
not provide enough detail to enable teachers to make any kind of
judgement regarding whether or not individual students are acquiring the
skills and understandings which the curriculum writers expect them to
acquire at each level. This is a weakness which it shares with the
previous science curriculum -- a weakness which was noticed by
reviewers. "The achievement objectives are . . . quite general and
require further interpretation to provide focussed learning outcomes
that can be usefully employed to assess student learning . . . For
example, 'investigate and communicate differences in the properties of
similar types of materials' (Material World, Level 2) requires teachers
to make decisions on which properties are reasonable and feasible for
students to explore, and the depth of understanding of the property that
can be expected" (Education Review Office, 2001). "The achievement
objectives do not provide an adequate basis for objectively measuring
and reporting student progress in a way that is meaningful" (Le Métais,
2002).

Publication of the supplementary materials has not solved this problem.
While the supplementary publications spell out in greater detail the
scientific principles which teachers need to understand and the topics
to be studied in each strand at each level, they remain silent on the
knowledge outcomes which all students are expected to acquire and on the
level of conceptual understanding which is expected of students at each
level. This means that teachers are receiving no guidance with respect
to either the assessment tasks which should be used or the level of
knowledge, understanding, or performance which define satisfactory and
unsatisfactory levels of development in science from year to year.
