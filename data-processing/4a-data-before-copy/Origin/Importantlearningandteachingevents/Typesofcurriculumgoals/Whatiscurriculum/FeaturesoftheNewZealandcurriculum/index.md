The New Zealand curriculum (Ministry of Education, 2007) covers the Year
levels 1 to 13, that is, ages 5 to 17. The curriculum statements apply
to all New Zealand schools including kura kaupapa MÃ¤ori and special
education schools.

The New Zealand curriculum is divided into eight essential learning
areas, that is, areas of knowledge and understanding which all students
are expected to acquire. These are as follows:

1.English

2.The Arts (Dance, Drama, Music-Sound Arts, and Visual Arts)

3.Health and Physical Education

4.Learning Languages

5.Mathematics and Statistics

6.Science

7.The Social Sciences

8.Technology

Incorporated into and across all eight learning areas are five key
competencies which are to be developed by all students. These key
competencies are:

-   Thinking
-   Using language, symbols and texts
-   Managing self
-   Relating to others
-   Participating and contributing

The school curriculum in New Zealand is two-tiered. Under the terms of
the Education Amendment Act 1991, it is the responsibility of boards of
trustees to ensure that schools satisfy the requirements and
expectations of the New Zealand curriculum. Every school charter and
proposed charter must include the aim of meeting and following the
learning principles and achievement objectives set out in the national
curriculum.

The New Zealand curriculum statements specify the achievement outcomes
which schools are legally obliged to pursue by listing, for boards of
trustees and teachers, a progression of performance objectives
throughout the years of schooling. However, this is done in a fairly
general way. Implementation of the curriculum, that is, the way in which
these outcomes are to be taught, achieved and assessed, is left to
individual schools to determine "in consultation with their
communities". The reason for this is to provide "for flexibility,
enabling schools and teachers to design programmes which are appropriate
to the learning needs of their students". This includes the flexibility
to plan programmes to meet their particular needs; for example, kaupapa
Maori programmes, English programmes for speakers of other languages
(ESOL), Pacific Islands language courses, and so on (as long as they
incorporate the knowledge and understandings described in the eight
learning areas).
