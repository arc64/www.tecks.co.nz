Some kinds of data can be presented only in words. Examples include
respondent self-reports of the situations in which they feel anxious, or
the social rules which operate in a given setting, and so on. Other
kinds of data can be presented numerically. Examples include
participant\'s scores on daily tests, measures of the time taken to
complete a particular task, and behaviour counts of various kinds. Until
the terms were redefined by qualitative researchers, data which could
only be described in words was referred to as *qualitative data* and
data which could be presented numerically was referred to as
*quantitative data* (Krathwohl, 1993). Some examples of qualitative and
quantitative data are shown in Table 3233.

Because numerical data have traditionally been considered to be more
scientifically respectable, early educational researchers often fell
into the habit of describing qualitative data using numerical indexes.
For example, the researcher\'s classification of a particular family on
a 5-point scale of *socio-economic status* might be given as "1" rather
than "the highest status category". However, as Stevens (1951) observed,
the use of a numerical index hides the fact that socio-economic status
is a nominal classification. No numerical operations are possible on the
entries in a nominal classification. Although category membership is
often treated as quantitative data, it is, in fact, qualitative data.
The classification of respondents according to gender, years of service,
income group, ethnicity, developmental stage, grade level, and so on is
still qualitative data because no numerical operations (apart from
counting) can be performed on such classifications.

Educational researchers have yet to resolve the question of when it is
appropriate to collect and report qualitative data and when it is
appropriate to collect and report quantitative data. At the present
time, the collection and reporting of qualitative data is on the
increase - largely as a result of an increase in the use of ethnographic
methods. One of the advantages of qualitative description is that it
allows the researcher to proceed without having to first invent a way of
measuring the kinds of changes which are of interest. The main advantage
of quantitative measures is that they are usually more directly
comparable from one investigation to another thus making it possible for
more than one investigator to work on the same research question.

The qualitative vs. quantitative question is a particularly important
question because one of the developments which defines the transition of
a field of inquiry from natural philosophy to natural science is the
transition from qualitative data and modes of description to
quantitative data and modes of description. Goldstein and Goldstein
(1978) illustrate this transition using as an example the development of
a standard measure to replace subjective judgements of hot, hotter and
hottest, that is, the development of the Fahrenheit scale to measure
temperature.
