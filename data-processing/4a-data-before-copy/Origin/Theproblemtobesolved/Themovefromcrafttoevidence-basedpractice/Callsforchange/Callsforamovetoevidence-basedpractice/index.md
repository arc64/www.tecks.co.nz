From researchers themselves, the call has been a call to begin the move
to evidence-based practice. "To improve the results achieved by schools,
the instructional practices that are shared widely across the profession
should be limited to those that are most likely to produce better
results" (Grossen, 1996, p. 2). Educational decisions "should be built
on objective data that can be inspected by a broad audience rather than
wishful thinking" (Carnine, 2000, p. 10).

Increasing numbers of teaching researchers are making the point that the
scientific study of learning is well advanced, that there are numerous
examples of teaching procedures and programmes which are much more
effective than those currently in use, and that teachers have an ethical
and professional obligation to provide students with the most effective
teaching discovered to date (e.g., Berninger, Dunn, Lin & Shimada, 2004;
Chall, 2002; Engelmann, 1992; Greenwood, 2001; Grossen, 1996; Landrum &
Tankersley, 2004; Raudenbush, 2005; Ravitch, 2000; Slavin, 2002;
Stanovitch, 1993/4; Vaughn & Dammann, 2001; Wheldall, 2005).

In the US this call was taken up by Congress in the form of the No Child
Left Behind legislation of 2001. "The phrase 'scientifically based
research' occurs more than 100 times in the Bush administration's No
Child Left Behind Act of 2001" (Traub, 2002, p. 1). Furthermore the
legislation includes funding incentives. For example, funding of some
\$5 billion over six years will be made available to states and
districts where reading is taught using 'scientifically based' methods.

In New Zealand, teaching researchers and teachers are coming under
increasing pressure from the Ministry of Education and the Education
Review Office to introduce teaching programmes and methods which will
reduce the gap in achievement between high achievers and low achievers,
between non-Maori and Maori students, and between non-PI and Pacific
Island students. In a major New Zealand literature review it is argued
that "this best evidence synthesis is intended to contribute
evidence-based and comprehensive strategies for optimising learning
opportunities for Maori and breaking patterns of system
under-performance for Maori" (Alton-Lee, 2003, p. 5).

These developments led the editors of the report of the National
Research Council's Committee on Scientific Principles in Educational
Research to conclude that "The current demand for scientific
understanding of educational phenomena is unmatched in history" (Feuer,
Towne & Shavelson, 2002, p. 11-12).
