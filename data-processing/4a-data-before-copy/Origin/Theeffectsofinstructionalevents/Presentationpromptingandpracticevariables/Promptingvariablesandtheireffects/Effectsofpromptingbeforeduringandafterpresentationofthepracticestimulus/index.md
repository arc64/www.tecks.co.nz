It is possible for a prompt to be presented prior to the practice
stimulus to which the learner is attempting to respond (premature
prompting), at the same time as the practice stimulus (simultaneous
prompting) or following presentation of the practice stimulus (delayed
prompting).

It is usually argued that prompts should be presented after the practice
stimulus so that the learner has to attend to the practice stimulus
(rather than simply attending to the prompt) and a number of experiments
have explored this assumption. These experiments have tended to involve
8- to 12-year old students either learning to read sight words (Didden,
Prinsen & Sigafoos, 2000) or learning the English translations of French
vocabulary words or Chinese characters (Adepoju & Elliott, 1997; Chung,
2002; Singh & Solman, 1990; Solman & Adepoju, 1995; Soman & Chung,
1996). In these experiments, students presented with picture prompts or
verbal prompts prior to or at the same time as they are presented with
the stimulus word have tended to remember fewer correct responses on
average than students in delayed prompting conditions. These experiments
tend to support the view that prompts should be introduced following the
practice stimulus, presumably because the student is more likely to
attend to the practice stimulus under these conditions.
