In order to acquire a new concept or generalisation the learner must
learn to distinguish between (and to respond differently to) instances
which are, and which are not, members of the stimulus class. There are
few concepts which can be taught using positive examples alone. The
great majority of concepts can only be mastered if the learner
experiences both examples and non-examples. Non-examples are necessary
to teach what the concept is *not*. In the Carnine experiments referred
to above, one of three groups of students was presented with a
restricted range of negative examples. When presented with transfer
items, these students made three times as many errors on negative
examples as did the students in the other two groups (Becker & Carnine,
1980).
