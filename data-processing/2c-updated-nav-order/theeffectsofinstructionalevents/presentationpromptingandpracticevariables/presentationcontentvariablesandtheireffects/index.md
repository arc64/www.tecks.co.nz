Because the purpose of a teacher presentation is to provide learners
with information about important curriculum content, the content of
individual presentations and the way in which that content is structured
and arranged is likely to be the major determinant of the learning which
results from the presentation. While there has been some research into
the effects of different ways of arranging content, to date this
research has been limited largely to studies of different ways of
organising teaching examples during the teaching of new concepts.
