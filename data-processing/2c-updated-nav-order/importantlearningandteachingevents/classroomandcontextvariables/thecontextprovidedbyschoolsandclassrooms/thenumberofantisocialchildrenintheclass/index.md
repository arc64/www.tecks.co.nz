The presence in the classroom of one or more children who engage in
antisocial behaviour or who fail to follow teacher directions makes the
classroom teacher's task much more complex than it would otherwise be.
While the misbehaviour of normally developing children can be managed
with contingent praise, warnings, and simple class-wide reward schemes,
these procedures do not work with antisocial children. This means that
the management of each poorly socialised child requires the
implementation of an effective, individualised behaviour plan and this
greatly increases the complexity of the classroom management task.

*Proportion of poorly socialised children in the class.* A second
important measure of the level of diversity in the classroom is a simple
count of the number of students who regularly fail to follow teacher
instructions and/or who engage in higher rates of antisocial children
than same age peers.
