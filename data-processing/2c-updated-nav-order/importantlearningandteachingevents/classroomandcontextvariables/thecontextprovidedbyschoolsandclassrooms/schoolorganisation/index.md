Classroom teaching occurs in schools. Schools vary with respect to the
way in which they are organised, their organisational efficiency, and
the extent to which school organisation supports classroom teaching and
learning. These variables have never been adequately defined and
procedures for measuring them have yet to be devised. However two simple
measures of the extent to which school organisation supports teaching
and learning in the classroom may be suggested.

*The number of classroom interruptions.* ** The number of unscheduled
interruptions to classroom teaching and learning activities during
school hours provides a learning sensitive measure of school
organisation in the sense that learning is more likely in classrooms
which experience a minimum of such interruptions. Unscheduled
interruptions include visits by school administration staff, other
teachers, student teachers or students from other classrooms, P.A.
announcements, evacuation drills, and so on which require the attention
of the classroom teacher.

*Total teaching time.* Schools are open for a statutory number of hours
each year. However, not all students spend all of these hours engaged in
curriculum relevant learning activities. Time is lost in transitions
from one activity to another, transitions from the classroom to other
parts of the school, school assemblies, staff meetings, sports days,
cultural activities, teacher sickness, student absenteeism, and the
withdrawal of individual students for various kinds of individual
attention. A second way of measuring the extent to which school and
classroom organisation supports learning is to calculate the time spent
by individual students in curriculum relevant learning activities as a
proportion of the total time in which the school is open.
